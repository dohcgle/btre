1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,200
All right guys so we're going to create our first app in Django.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,500
OK.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,300
So again apps you have you have multiple apps per project.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,990
This is going to be the pages app which is going to take care of displaying the home page and the About

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,040
page and any other static pages that you would want to create.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,480
And you can bring models into it like for instance our home page.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,730
We're going to want the latest listings on our boat page we're going to want realtors and this stuff

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,880
is going to come from the database.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,490
So what we can do is we can import models from the listings app or from the realtor's app into pages

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,050
so that we can display it.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,450
All right but for now we're just going to focus on just getting a home page and an About page set up.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,570
So I have my server running down here so I'm going to open up a new terminal here and make sure you're

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,550
in your virtual environment and let's create the pages app so to do that.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:04,500
We're going to say Python say Python manage dot PI and then we're going to say start app and then we

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,630
want to name it so we're going to call this pages.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,380
OK so we'll run that.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,000
And what happens is it creates a new folder called pages with a bunch of files inside of it.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,710
So these are all the default files for when you create now.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,180
So we have an IT UP HIGH just like we do and be Tiare it's just completely empty we don't have to worry

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,970
about it.

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,730
Migrations is for any database migrations we create.

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,720
We're not going to have any migrations for this particular app but we will in some of the other ones

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,620
admen is if you want to like you want to show stuff in the admin area.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,860
We're not going to need to do that here in our listings app.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,170
We will because we'll want to will want to manage our listings from the admin area but we won't touch

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,070
this one.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,470
And then AppStore pie.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,540
This shows you the class of the conflict.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,950
This will actually have to go in our settings file or show you that in the second models.

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,010
This is where we create our models.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,340
This particular app doesn't have a model but for instance listings will have like the the title The

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,790
address the number of bedrooms all that stuff is going to be defined inside of a model.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,680
Then we have our tests if we want to run any tests and have used up my file where we can create methods

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,330
and we can actually link you or else to those methods.

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,790
So first thing I want to do it before I forget.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,160
Because a lot of times I do forget is to add this app to our settings so lets go to the BTR settings

37
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,000
up high and what we're going to want to put here and the installed apps is a set of quotes and a comma

38
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,910
and we're going to say pages dot apps.

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,430
Daut pages.

40
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,340
Config.

41
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,360
OK so we want to go like that in where I got this page config from is in the App Store pi.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,230
So whatever this is right here is what goes right here.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:08,440
So if I save this that will cause Django to recognize this as an app right now what I saved I got this

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,500
message down here in vs code.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,950
So if you're using the code and you get this auto pep 8 message this is a formatter.

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Now if you just go ahead and click yes I believe it installs it globally and you're going to have some

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,690
issues with paths and stuff.

48
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,480
So what I would suggest doing is going to your terminal while you're in your virtual environment and

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:41,760
then doing a Pipp install an auto pap 8 like that.

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,530
And that should install in your virtual environment.

51
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,950
And if we close this up.

52
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,160
Let's just do a pip freeze.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,850
This can become a real pain in the butt.

54
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,780
Yeah you see now we have autopay have eight so hopefully we don't get that message anymore.

55
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,820
All right so let me just try to resave this and make sure that we don't get that.

56
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,110
OK.

57
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,570
We don't.

58
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,510
Good.

59
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,540
All right so let's close that up.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,330
And now what I wanted to do is create a pie file for this pages app.

61
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:19,110
So inside the pages folder here let's create a new file called Earles dot pi.

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,710
OK.

63
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,470
And we're going to have to bring in here.

64
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:35,520
See we're going to save from Django So the main Gengel package Daut you ourselves.

65
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,240
We want to import something called paff.

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,140
OK.

67
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,500
And if we look at the other you are a closed door pie file you'll see that they do the same thing because

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,980
if you want to define a path like this you have to actually bring that path package in.

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,490
So back to the other you are Elle's dot Pi.

70
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:01,190
We want to then bring in the views because the idea here is to have a path that or u r l or a path or

71
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,450
row whatever you want to call it that is attached to a method.

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,400
Inside this view file.

73
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,400
Ok so we want a u r l for our home page.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,230
So to bring in the views we want to say from all import views.

75
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,290
Okay.

76
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,670
And then down here we want to define u r l patterns just like the other file.

77
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,640
OK.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:31,400
So we'll set that to a list and then let's say path because we brought in path and the path that I want

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,430
is just nothing.

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,520
Which means the root path like the home page.

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,640
OK and a lot of not a lot of frameworks and stuff you'll see just slash but we're just going to leave

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,740
this empty.

83
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,440
OK the second parameter is going to be the method we want to connect this to in the view.

84
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,160
So we want to say views Daut and then the method which is going to be called index and then the final

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,170
parameter is going to be the name.

86
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,560
OK we're going to set a name here to easily access this path which we'll call index.

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,030
All right so going to save that.

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,820
Now we're getting in error here.

89
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,520
And it says that there's no index member So basically it's we're getting this because there's no there's

90
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,420
no method called index inside the views file.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,090
So let's take care of that.

92
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:24,310
Let's go to views and we'll get rid of that line here and actually let me make this smaller.

93
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,550
And then let's write a function so we say def index.

94
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,670
When I say function or method I'm using those interchangeably.

95
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:41,450
So we'll define this as index and we want to pass in a request here as a parameter and then put a colon

96
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,980
and then what we want to happen here.

97
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,090
Now ultimately we want to render a template for the home page.

98
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:59,600
But for now I'm just going to bring in we're going to say from Django dot h t t p we want to import

99
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:08,050
and saying Poor HTP response need to get these drop downs because we have the python extension installed.

100
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,650
And then and here let's simply return let's say return HTP response.

101
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:23,810
And inside here we'll just say we can actually put h Tim Allen here we'll put an H on and we'll say

102
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,980
hello world.

103
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,930
All right we'll save that.

104
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,660
OK.

105
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,960
Now this isn't going to work yet.

106
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,170
If I go to our application it opens.

107
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,560
Where is it right here.

108
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,580
And we reload we still see this page because what we need to do is we need to take this you are Elle's

109
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,220
PI file that we created and we knew why is we.

110
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,980
Why are we still getting this error pages of views has no index member should it does

111
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,330
that's weird There you go.

112
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,160
All right.

113
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,110
Now we want to go to the other you or else.

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,840
Pi the main one in the very folder and I'm just going to get rid of all these comments because we don't

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,330
need those OK.

116
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,800
And we want to go right here.

117
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,350
Let's go.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:30,390
But this will go above the admin and say paff tree put a comma here and then whatever we want the main

119
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,460
the the first segment of the R L to be for the pages app.

120
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,670
Now I don't want it to be anything because I don't want to have to go to like pages slash about or pages

121
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,870
slash anything.

122
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,040
Otherwise we would do that.

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,460
I want to be able to just go to slash about and just nothing for the home page just slash So we're going

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,640
actually going to leave this blank OK for listings and stuff like that.

125
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,360
Then we'll have listings slash or realtors whatever whatever the path may be.

126
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,880
But in this case I want to leave it blank.

127
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,270
All right.

128
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,900
And then we want to include.

129
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,390
So we want to include.

130
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,900
And then inside quotes here pages Daut you are Elle's.

131
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,660
Okay so we're essentially linking to the you are L's pie of the pages app.

132
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,770
If I save this we're going to get an error.

133
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,580
And the reason for that is because include we actually need to bring that in because that's part of

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,050
the Django you are Elle's package.

135
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,290
So we simply need to put a comma here and say we want to bring in includes so that we can use it and

136
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,030
I'll save that and now you'll see that that error goes away.

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,910
And now we should be able to access the index.

138
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,690
Okay.

139
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,320
Which should be just the home page because we left this blank.

140
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,540
So let's check it out.

141
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,150
Let's go to our It's the let's go here and reload and there we go.

142
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,480
So we're getting Hello world.

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:07,430
Now obviously we don't want to if I go back to our views we don't want to be putting our h team inside

144
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,790
of inside here like inside an HDP response we want to actually render a template.

145
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,950
So in the next video I'm going to show you how we can do that and we're going to create templates folder

146
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:25,040
and we'll start to create a structure there so that we can add our each team around to be served instead

147
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,830
of putting it right into a response like this.
