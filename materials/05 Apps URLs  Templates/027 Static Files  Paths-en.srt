1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,460
All right guys so now we're going to start to think about implementing our bootstrap theme bringing

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,370
it into our Django application so that that's what displays in the front end web site.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,960
But I want to just take a look at how to handle static files because this is something that can be very

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,300
confusing it's something that confused me at first.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,410
So I just tried to really follow along here.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,330
So I have our project arbitrary project folder or this is just our route Gengel project and then we

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,090
have our Beati very theme which is included in your resources and we don't care about any of this stuff

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,750
or we care about is the disk folder which has our h team l files.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,580
But right now I want to focus on this assets folder.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,370
OK this has like all of our CSSA our bootstrap everything all the javascript all the images the fonts

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,570
for fun awesome all that stuff.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,200
So we want to bring this into our application as as static assets.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,760
So in our BTR project what we're going to do is go into this folder this Tiare folder and I'm going

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,600
to create a new folder and I'm going to call this static.

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,700
OK.

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,270
And then this is where I want to put our main static files.

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,980
So the whole CSSA folder or the whole JSM the whole web fonts.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm going to copy and bring that in.

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,800
Now the images some of this stuff we don't want because like the homes for example these are all images

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,870
we're actually going to upload through the admin area when we create our listings same thing with the

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,700
realtors.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,510
So we don't want those all we really want is the light box and then the these images.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,260
OK so we want these in a folder called I Am G.

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,410
So let's create I'm a Pierre OK.

25
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:57,820
And then we're going to bring let's bring all of these images and the Lightbox folder OK.

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,760
So just to reiterate inside our main BTR project we have a folder called B-tree that was generated when

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,510
we ran start project from Django admen and then we put our static folder in there and I just brought

28
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,940
everything into that.

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,620
OK.

30
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,910
So let's make sure that you have that.

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,690
OK so now we need to go to our settings file.

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,380
So we want to go to be Tiare settings dot pi and you can see at the bottom here we actually have a static

33
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,910
you are all set to static.

34
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,210
But we want to add two other things here.

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:40,620
One is going to be the static route OK and the idea of this is when you deploy your application you

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,220
run a command called collect static and it goes into all of your applications or all of your apps and

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,340
if it has a static folder it takes everything out and puts it into a root static folder.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,130
So that's what we're defining here so we're going to say OS dot path dot joined just like we did with

39
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,410
the templates and say base directory and then static.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,590
OK.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:16,000
And then we want to do one more value here which is going to be static files underscore der's.

42
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,020
OK.

43
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,390
And we want to set the location of the static folder we just created which is in this BT houri folder.

44
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:40,290
So the way that we can do that is OS dot path join base Durer and then we want b t r e slash static

45
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,340
OK so that should be the correct configuration.

46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,920
Let's save this.

47
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:57,810
Now if I bring this up here and I do a python manage dog PI help you'll see there's actually a command

48
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,320
called collect static.

49
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,970
OK so that should actually find any static folders we have and create one into whatever we define as

50
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,320
the static route.

51
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,330
OK and you could call this anything assets.

52
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,300
Well I'm just going to leave it a static.

53
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,460
But let's go ahead and try to run that.

54
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:24,170
So if you say Python mintage Daut PI and we say collect static Let's run that.

55
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,350
OK so for static files copied and you can see that it is actually created a static folder in our root

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,960
which has not only the stuff that we put in in the Tiare but also the admin.

57
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,100
OK the static admin files.

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,460
So when we deploy this is actually where it looks for everything including the admin CSSA and all that

59
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,170
stuff.

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,690
So once we put this on our server we want to run that command.

61
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,280
Now one thing we don't want is to push this to our repository.

62
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,490
So we're going to go to our dog get ignore and we're actually going to add slash static.

63
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,220
OK.

64
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,250
And then another thing that I forgot to do is to add a slash in front of media because I only want the

65
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,160
root static in media to not be pushed to the to the repository.

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,050
All right so we'll go ahead and save that.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,800
OK and you can make your get comments in that on your own but now that we have that there are static

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,380
files set up we can move on to basically bring in our bootstrap theme bring in all that markup.

69
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,940
So that's what we're going to do in the next video.
