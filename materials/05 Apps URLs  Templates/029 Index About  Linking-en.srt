1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,050
So in the last video we took care of our Levo using bootstrap and using you know putting the top bar

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,490
the now on the footer and because these are things that are going to be on every single page.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,010
So we wanted these in our base.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,400
Each Al file.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,260
I also showed you how to link static assets using load's static.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,100
So now we're going to work on the inner content here.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,700
So we'll start on the index page.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,970
So let's head over to Sublime Text which has just daar our theme.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,960
This is all just the HVM owl.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,730
And what I'm going to do is copy everything that we don't have that we didn't put into the base aged

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,070
him.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:42,000
So we have the footer and the script and stuff so let's start right here at the bottom above the water

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,340
and then go all the way up until we hit under the nav bar.

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,170
OK which already past's we want to go back down.

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,340
So right here to the showcase.

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,510
OK so going to copy all this and this is all going to go into our index each team.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,650
Now remember right now everything is just static it's like this form is obviously not going to work.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,190
We're not going to get the latest listings or have we haven't even installed the database yet we just

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,440
want to get the markup to show and it's going to be like that for quite a while until we get into creating

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,090
our models and all that stuff.

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,000
So just keep that in mind.

23
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,720
All right so let's head to when they have so many things open at once.

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:37,090
We're going to go to our project and close this up actually base each team so we can close up for now

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:45,470
and then let's go to let's see templates pages and then index each team out which should look like this

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,910
right now.

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,270
All right.

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,210
And then we're going to just replace this H-1 with everything that we just copied.

29
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,540
So I'm going to paste all of that in and save.

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,160
And then let's go back to Chrome and reload and there we go.

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,760
So we have basically just kind of a shell of an application.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,340
So it's not actually fetching anything or anything like that it's just basically the H Tim L placed

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,510
in a template.

34
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:22,220
Now as far as the listings here remember we're going to be adding the listings from the admin area which

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,490
we haven't even talked about yet.

36
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,890
So the images will come from somewhere different.

37
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,250
They're not going to come from the static files.

38
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,520
Ok so this will look like this for now.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,920
So don't worry about that yet and then.

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,450
Yes so the rest will just keep as is.

41
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,840
Now let's do the same with the home page.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,570
So I'm going to go to the theme that I have open in sublime text and go to about aged hemol and just

43
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,740
get everything below the nav bar basically between the nav bar and the foot or so here.

44
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,680
And if I scroll down to here right above the footer I'm going to copy that.

45
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:13,940
OK we're going to go to the about dot each team L in our jingle app and we're going to paste that in.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,160
So let's save that.

47
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,360
Let's take a look.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,950
So now I'm just going to navigate to slash about and there's a boat page.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,890
Now remember there is a static image on this page.

50
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,520
OK so there is that picture of the inside of the office.

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,420
So we do want we do want to include that.

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,080
So it's head on over back to to that about each team.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,690
All this other stuff the realtors this is going to be coming from the database so we don't need to worry

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,450
about that or the seller of the month.

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:58,950
We just want to go up to see right here where it's loading this assets about J bag so we want to actually

56
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,360
load static and it's very important to know that when you extend a label like we are here it has to

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,740
be the first line.

58
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,600
So our load static can't go at the top it has to go below that.

59
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,440
So it's a load static.

60
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,560
And then we'll go back down to this about JPEG.

61
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,090
Let's get rid of this.

62
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,100
Hey we're just doing the same thing that we've been doing by saying static.

63
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,910
I want to wrap this in single quotes and then close that up right.

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,100
So I'll save that let's take a look and we reload and there's the image.

65
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,100
All right so now what I want to do is talk about linking.

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,930
OK so linking to.

67
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,140
You know we have the in the breadcrumbs we have a link.

68
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,170
We have a link here.

69
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,120
This will go to the listings which hasn't been created yet.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,740
So we'll do that a little later.

71
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:00,440
We'll also do link in the nav bar at the home and the about at least so to link let's use the breadcrumb

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,510
right here so you can see it's going to index each year and that's obviously not what we want.

73
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:13,850
So here we want to put in our tags and we want to do you Arel single quote and then index.

74
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,470
OK.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,050
So let's try that in a reload.

76
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,530
I'm going to hit home brings us back home now that index.

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:29,420
If you're wondering what this is where this come comes from is if we go to our pages app and we go to

78
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:38,420
pi we named this index so we can use this basically and you know to link to same thing with a boat.

79
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,820
So let's go to our NAV K.R. now.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Partial here.

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,900
And we have the branding which I want to go to the home page so we'll simply

82
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,850
throwing you r l index there.

83
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:05,570
Same thing for home.

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
And then for about

85
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,020
we're going to say you are old both because it's the name we gave it.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:27,570
So save now for relo we should be able to go back and forth Okay now for listing know we have a featured

87
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,930
listings if we try and do that here.

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,170
You are all OK.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,110
So if I save that we go back and reload we get an error because that doesn't exist.

90
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,970
It doesn't even let us put it as a link.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,130
It just it's just just not going to work.

92
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,250
So for now I'm just going to do.

93
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,500
Index.

94
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,840
OK.

95
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,940
And then later on when we create our listings app we'll fix this.

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,230
All right.

97
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,210
So now what I want to do is handle the highlighting of the link because right now if we look if we go

98
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,670
on the About page home it's still highlighted it's still active and if you're not familiar with bootstrap

99
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,190
what's causing that is the class of active on the fly.

100
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,080
OK if we move the active to the ally of about that will be highlighted but we want this to be dynamic

101
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,340
if we go to the About page we want that to be highlighted and this is going to add a little bit of clutter

102
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,760
to your template because we have to use conditionals.

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,230
But if you want that functionality then this is this is how you're going to have to do it.

104
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,520
I mean there are there's other ways to do it.

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,400
There may even be shorter ways like cleaner ways but this is just the way that I do it.

106
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,820
So what we want to do is we need a conditional if that condition was met.

107
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,660
So if this is the home page we want to display class with active if it's not we want to display class

108
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,040
without active.

109
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,200
So I'm going to get rid of actually going to copy.

110
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,890
I'm going to copy this or cut it rather.

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,240
And this ally I'm actually going to go onto the next line and make sure that the year inside the ally

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,470
you the angle bracket down here and we want to do an F..

113
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,040
OK.

114
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,310
So in these these templates you can do if statements.

115
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:30,180
So I want to say if slash is equal to request Daut paff case who are testing the request path.

116
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,930
So basically the page if that's true then I'm going to paste in what we have.

117
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,070
So we want class and we want active included in that.

118
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:55,830
Now if it's not so we want to do an else if it's not then we want class with out active in that.

119
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,620
OK so let's save that let's test that that out.

120
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,910
So if I reload this unclose tag.

121
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh I forgot the N.F..

122
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,230
So right here we have to do a

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,280
END-IF

124
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,860
OK.

125
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,510
So about there it is it's highlighted a I mean I'm sorry home it's highlighted.

126
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,120
We go to a about and it's not.

127
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,750
So we need to do the same for a bone.

128
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,390
So what I'll do is copy all of this.

129
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,940
So the whole Eli tag to the last angle bracket and then I'm going to just paste this in for this.

130
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,780
The ABOUT ally like that and the condition is going to be a bit different when it's not the home page.

131
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,140
So instead of doing like Slash equals request path we're going to do if

132
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,280
about.

133
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:05,530
OK so if about in request path request path OK if that's true then we want active.

134
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,580
If not we don't.

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:14,960
So save that and let's go back to our browser and reload and you see home is highlighted.

136
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,290
Now if I go to a boat a boat is highlighted OK or active.

137
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,360
So good.

138
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,740
Now once we do the listings We'll have that working as well.

139
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:30,530
Same thing with the register and log in but for now we only have the index in about page so that's all

140
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,480
we're going to do for now.

141
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:31,980
All right.

142
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,910
So just a quick note before we move on I know that I've said this I said this in the beginning but this

143
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,040
is a little different than a lot of other courses it's not just Django like here's how you do this here's

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,920
how you do this.

145
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,490
We're building an app a real application and I'm building it as if it were a real application.

146
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:56,150
And what I would do is have all of the templates created all the views in the UI before I do anything

147
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,250
with the database.

148
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,590
Setting up models migrations.

149
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,550
Stuff like that the admin area.

150
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,420
I just want to get the front end UI done before we do that.

151
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,170
OK so next what we'll do is create our listings app.

152
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,440
OK we're going to create our listings app and I think we'll create the realtor's app too at the same

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,200
time and get that template up.

154
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,500
So when we can actually go to a featured listings and we'll see the static content.

155
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:29,450
And then once we do that we can start to think about our models and how to set them up and you know

156
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,540
obviously we need to install postgrads and all that stuff.

157
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,040
All right so hopefully you guys can appreciate that it's not really a traditional course it's more of

158
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,130
a project you know hands on project course.

159
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,230
So that's it.

160
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,680
I will see you in the next video.
