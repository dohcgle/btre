1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,920
All right guys soon the last video we took care of are static files.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:12,300
We should have a BT houri folder with the static folder for all our stuff that we created you know with

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,710
our theme and then our main static folder in the room will have that all that plus the admin.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,610
OK and this is when we when we deploy.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,150
This is where it'll look to.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,450
All right.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,640
So now what I want to do is start to implement our bootstrap theme.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,050
So I'm on my base.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,800
Each team will lay out which is in the templates folder and we're going to start to kind of just add

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,660
stuff here to this.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,270
This file from our bootstrap theme.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,290
Now the way that I'm going to do this is I'm going to use Sublime Text which is a different text editor.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,070
Hold on let me just open up a new window here and I'm going to open up the bootstrap theme in Sublime

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,060
Text that way I don't get confused by which is which you know so I'll know that if it's Sublime Text

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,560
it's just the theme just the each team.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,310
And our main project is in vs code so you don't have to do this if you want to open it in the same text

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,950
editor or something else whenever you want to do is absolutely fine.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,820
But this is what I'm doing so I'm going to go to a project and you guys can see the menu but I'm going

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:26,340
to project add folder to project and I'm going to find my C desktop I'm going to go to VTR resources

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,460
BTR theme and I want the dist folder or I don't care about any of this.

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,580
That's just for development for the theme.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,690
So we just want our disks folder.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,410
All right.

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,990
So now over here I'm going to open up in next each team Mallam We want to start to bring some of this

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,840
stuff over so we're gonna start with the head.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,560
This is where we include our static files like Fonte awesome bootstrap our custom style sheet and so

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,850
on.

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,850
So we're going to copy these lines and go back to vs code into our base each DML and I'm going to paste

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,140
these in.

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,510
All right then I'm going to go and navigate to the bottom where we have all the javascript which are

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,040
these three script tags here and I'm going to copy these and I'm going to go to vs code.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm going to put that right above the ending body tag.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,200
OK.

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:23,190
Now if I save this the way it is obviously I know that a lot of you guys know that this is not going

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,380
to work.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,870
So if I reload this and we take a look at our chrome tools and our cons. we're going to get a ton of

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,450
errors here because it's looking for these files in there.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,940
They're nowhere to be found.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,440
OK because if we look at where that pointing to it's looking at assets CSSA we don't even have an assets

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,500
folder.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,690
So the way that we can reference the static files that we just brought in we have to we have to actually

42
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,300
do a couple things here.

43
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,850
So at the very top of this each time I'll file if you want to use static if you want to use the special

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,420
static helper I guess we can call it you want to use your template tags here and you just want to say

45
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,380
load static like that.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,240
OK.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:20,280
Now wherever we have a static file coming in like let's say this all DOD CSX which is the font.

48
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,860
Awesome file.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,390
What we want to do is in the ATRA if we want to first of all get rid of this asset slash because there's

50
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,670
no such thing in our jingle project.

51
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,020
And we want to open up a template tag.

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:45,250
So we want to do percent and we want to see a static static and just space and then we want to wrap

53
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:56,300
the CSSA slash all Dotsie SS in single quotes and then we want to end that and the tag like that.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,530
All right so this will actually reference whatever our static folder is which we defined in our settings

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,930
and it will look for a CSSA slash all Dotsie SS and it should be able to find it hopefully.

56
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,540
So now I'm just going to copy this whole thing here.

57
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,270
And let's go to the next one which is bootstrap and we'll paste that in and we'll just change this to

58
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:28,110
bootstrap and then this one here will change this to stifle.

59
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,370
All right so that should take care of the CSSA actually.

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,610
I forgot the light box that's in there correct.

61
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,930
Yes.

62
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,670
Light box.

63
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,760
MAN Yeah.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,820
All right so let's add that as well.

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,130
So say live blogs

66
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,800
and I'm just going to copy this

67
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:03,880
and this is going to be light box dot men dot CSSA OK and the reason it wasn't here is because I copied

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,020
this from the index page in the theme and the index didn't include this file.

69
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,730
So now let's go down to the bottom here where we have the these stack the javascript and it's the same

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,210
idea.

71
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:29,250
So what we can do is again use our template tags and say static wrap this in single quotes like that

72
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,170
and then close it.

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,250
So I keep doing like a peach tag.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,380
Actually that would be a dollar sign for BHP but we want to do the same kind of thing so let's actually

75
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,540
just copy like this

76
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:55,980
and that should actually be G-S slash and then let's do the same thing right here.

77
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:05,390
And then we want just the end to be a single quote and then a closing tag like that.

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,190
All right so again it should be looking in whatever our static folder is and then looking at these locations.

79
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,230
OK.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,320
And then again we want to add the light box so I forgot about that.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,770
So let's copy that down.

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,390
We'll do J.S. slash lightbox dot dot Yes.

83
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,930
All right so I'm sure that that's saved.

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,230
And let's go back to Crome and now you can see bootstrap is already working here.

85
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,250
And we just move this over a little bit go.

86
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,780
All right.

87
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,440
So bootstrap is kicked in.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,250
And the only errors we're getting over here because we don't have the the Jay J.A.G. loading gif I don't

89
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,430
have that there and that's fine.

90
00:06:51,440 --> 00:07:00,240
This enraged hemol is because if we look at our main J.S. So let's take a look at our main J.S..

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,700
What's going on is in the template there's a class of year div with the class of year or a span I think

92
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,490
it is and we're just putting in the year dynamically using javascript and that that span doesn't exist.

93
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,420
So it's giving us an error as soon as we add that that error will go away so there's no need to to worry

94
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,770
about that.

95
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,110
All right but this is how we implement static files inside of our template.

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,690
So now what we're going to do is start to bring over some of the stuff that we want on every page like

97
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,710
the nav bar the top bar things like that.

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,290
So if we head over to sublime texts where we have our theme let's go up to the top and let's grab the

99
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,700
top bar.

100
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,700
So I'm just going to grab this.

101
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,310
All of it.

102
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,700
And then also the nav bar which is directly under it and stop there because the showcase Obviously that

103
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,500
doesn't go on every page so we're going to going to copy this.

104
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,420
The nav bar on the top bar.

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,730
Go back to our base.

106
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,980
Each team now.

107
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,830
And let's put this right above the block content.

108
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,390
All right so you put that above the block content and then the other thing that goes on every page is

109
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,320
the footer.

110
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,890
So I'm going to go back to our theme and go all the way down and grab our footer and this is what I

111
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,490
was talking about a spam with the class of year this is where the year gets inserted.

112
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,430
And it wasn't finding that so it was giving us that console error.

113
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,680
So let's copy this and go back and put this after the block content.

114
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,340
So right here right.

115
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:48,910
And have prettier formatting on save anymore so she can fix that up a little bit.

116
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,960
All right so let's save that and let's go ahead and take a look.

117
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,930
And there we go.

118
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,940
All right cool.

119
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,410
So these are going to show on every page if we go to slash about and see this go to sleep.

120
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,980
No this goes to about age DML But we'll fix that.

121
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,040
But let's just check out slash about.

122
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,390
And you can see now we're on the About page.

123
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,920
One last thing I want to do before I end this video is is show you that we can use Parshall's.

124
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:23,480
OK so I don't want our base each team out to be cluttered up with all of this markup.

125
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,730
So what we can do is we can create a separate folder in our templates folder called Parshall's

126
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,770
right now inside Parshall's.

127
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,670
I want to put the nav bar everything we just brought in the nav bar the top bar in the footer.

128
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,240
So we want to separate full separate file for all of those.

129
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,410
Now since there Parshall's the convention is to use an underscore in front so we're going to say underscore

130
00:09:53,050 --> 00:10:01,820
nav bar Daut aged him well and will create underscore top bar door age Himmel.

131
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,560
And let's also create underscore for Dot aged him.

132
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,790
OK and then we can simply bring that stuff in.

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,780
So we'll start off with the top bar.

134
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,630
I'm going to go from here.

135
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:24,420
Went too far down to here and just cut that and we're going to put that in the top bar each team out

136
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:33,970
and save K and just close it for now and then the nav bar will grab all that mark up which ends right

137
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,080
here.

138
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,310
Cut that out.

139
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,420
Put it in here and save.

140
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,780
And then finally the FOTR will cut that.

141
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,580
Put that in footer save that.

142
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,060
And now we just need to bring those in and that's.

143
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,560
That's very simple with using the template syntax.

144
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,660
I'm going to just put a comment and say top bar

145
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:13,290
here we want to use our template tags and we want to just to include it in the Parshall's folder and

146
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,340
underscore taught by DOT HMO.

147
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,550
OK so I'm just going to copy that.

148
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,300
Or go down below.

149
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,600
And this is going to be the nav bar.

150
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,130
So it will include

151
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,130
nav bar each time.

152
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,680
All right.

153
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,790
And here let's say main content.

154
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,140
And then lastly we want the faulter

155
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,750
underscore for each email.

156
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,460
So save.

157
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,110
Now we should get the same results.

158
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,180
Let's go back and reload and we get the same thing okay.

159
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,120
All the logo.

160
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,540
So the logo is also a static asset.

161
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,280
So if to do the same thing we did for this like the CSSA and the javascript and all that.

162
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,080
So we're going to go to our NAV bar partial because that's where the logo is you can see we still have

163
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,590
it pointing to like assets.

164
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,460
So we want to change that.

165
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:37,070
Now remember if we're going to be using static we need to up at the top we need to load static Kay.

166
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,400
And then once we go down to her we have our logo.

167
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:49,000
We're going to get rid of the assets and we're going to put in our template tag and say static and then

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,730
put this in single quotes and then end it.

169
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,250
All right.

170
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,460
So go ahead and save that.

171
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,840
And let's go back reload and there's our logo.

172
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,110
All right so we can close this up.

173
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,710
And in the next video I want to start to add some of the stuff for the index page.

174
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,860
Will move to the about will also take care of the links here.

175
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,320
We can use some special conditionals to make these active when we're on the correct page.

176
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,940
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
