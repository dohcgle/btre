1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,060
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,120
In the last video we went ahead and we created our pages app.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,450
We created a U R L to the index view or I'm sorry index method inside the views file which is right

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,910
here and then we're just outputting or returning and HDP response that outputs in H1.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,380
OK so that's that's all we're seeing right here.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,860
Now what we want to do is I'll put a template so there's a couple steps we need to take the first we

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,960
need to tell Django where to look for templates what folder to look at.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,450
So in setting's dot PI you want to go down to the templates list right here it has a dictionary with

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,390
the all these values these key value pairs.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,550
And we want to go to this der's this directory's and we want to tell it where to look.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,970
So where I put my templates is right in the root so not in any of these folders here just right along

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:03,000
side them so to let it know that we're going to say OS dot path dot join and we're going to use our

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,470
base underscore Durr variable which just basically says the base directory or the root directory and

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,490
then we want to define the folder name and we want to use which is templates.

15
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,640
So it's go and save that.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,030
All right.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,880
And then we want to go into our root here and create a folder called templates.

18
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,150
Now it's up to you how you want to structure your templates.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,530
I like to categorize them.

20
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,720
So for instance our pages app will have a couple of its own templates so we'll create a folder called

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,380
pages that will have a folder called listings and so on.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,420
So we're going to create a folder in templates called pages and then I'm going to create two files in

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,020
here one is going to be indexed on each team.

24
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,140
And then one is going to be about the dot h t.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,920
L k for the about page and just going to do an H-1 that says a boat can save for index I'll do an H-1

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,810
that says

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,560
home and save.

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,280
OK so now that we have our templates created we need to first of all go to our pages app and then you

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,930
are Elazar pi because right now we don't have an About route just for the index.

30
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,120
It's going to put a comma here.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,740
Bring that down.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,750
We'll call this one about.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,870
And then the method name that I'm going to use is also going to be about in the route is also about.

34
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,170
So save this we're going to get an error here because there is no about method in the views file so

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,640
we're going to create that now.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:52,230
So in views let's say let's say Def about.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,860
OK.

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,540
Now we don't want to just return an H T P response for either one of these.

39
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,030
We want to render a template.

40
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,880
We're actually already bringing in render up here so that's what we want to use.

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,860
So instead of this we're going to say return render.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,400
And this takes in two things for now which is going to be the request itself and then the location of

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,890
the template which is in pages slash index dot HMO.

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,150
I know we're going to do the same thing for the about so more tab over here and paste that in and just

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:38,710
change this to about and save with it oh I forgot my parentheses and request.

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,300
OK.

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,830
Now you are up high we're still seeing this error.

48
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,620
We just need to resave it and that will go away.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,570
OK so now this should work.

50
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,720
Let's head make sure your server is running.

51
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,620
My server running in this.

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,920
This tab right here.

53
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,230
Also always make sure you're in your virtual environment.

54
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:58,690
OK.

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,310
Make sure you have this van or whatever you called it and I will mention if you install an extension

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,350
in vs code and you reload.

57
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,910
It's going to knock you out of your virtual environments.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,030
You want to go back in.

59
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,230
If you're using your integrated terminal So now let's go back to Chrome and reload.

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,480
And now we see home.

61
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:26,220
OK so it's loading the index each time template in the pages folder in the templates folder if go to

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,470
about we see about.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,030
OK so that's perfect.

64
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,320
All right.

65
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:41,110
Now the issue with with this what we're doing now is if we want to of course we do want to have like

66
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,830
a head section we want our age to smell had body tags all of our CSSA references javascript references

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,100
that stuff we don't want to have to repeat on every template like him in the index in the about anything

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,300
else we create.

69
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,110
So we want to extend a base layout.

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,270
OK so what world what we'll do is in the templates folder not inside pages but just inside templates

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,300
will create a file called base dot h T.M. and then this is going to be just that our base.

72
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,030
Each team that we can extend from other templates.

73
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,950
Okay and this is going to have like all our H.T. email had tags and stuff like that.

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,830
So when you use Emett by doing exclamation tabs just to give us a boilerplate here title will say Beati

75
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,810
real estate and I'll show you how to do dynamic titles later in our body.

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,240
This is where we want to output any template that we extend OK or that so that we use to extend this

77
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,090
layout.

78
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,150
So to do that we're going to use the Jinja syntax Jinja is the template engine that Gengel uses by default

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
and that is curly braces and percent signs.

80
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,690
OK so you can kind of think this is like ph P If you've ever if you've ever written ph P inside your

81
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,570
aged female you need to open up your Ph p tags to run that code.

82
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,770
This is similar.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,590
We need to open up our Jinja tags or template tags whatever you want to call them.

84
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,660
And then here we want to save block content.

85
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,540
OK.

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:18,360
And then we need to end that block by doing another set of tags and say and block.

87
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,800
All right so I'll save that in then any template that we want to extend this layout from.

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,220
We actually have to do a couple of things we have to first go up here use our tags AUPs use our tags

89
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:42,970
and say extends a little save based on age Tamal and then we just need to wrap the content in that block

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
content content.

91
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,250
Okay.

92
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:53,440
And then at the end of it we need to do and block.

93
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,950
All right so save that now.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,840
The way my editor is formatted it kind of pushes this up here which kind of sucks but it's just something

95
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,330
that we'll deal with for now.

96
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,490
So let's go back to the home page

97
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,290
and now you'll see that the title says Beati real estate.

98
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,080
And if I were to look at my source code it includes all that you know the doc type each Tamal the head

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
body all that stuff and includes all of it.

100
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,580
And it's like it's like inserting the template right here.

101
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,260
OK.

102
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,660
So now let's do the same for a bow because right now if we go to slash about you'll see that there is

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,630
no title it's not extending that leo.

104
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,410
So I'll just copy this here and go to a bow and we'll go ahead and push that down and paste that in.

105
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,090
And we just want to end the block

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,610
that you will go back and reload.

107
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,140
And now we get our title in it that that layout is being extended.

108
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:06,880
Now if you're using this code you do have the option to install the Jinja extension.

109
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:15,510
So if we go to extensions and we search for Jinja it would be this first one here I believe me just

110
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,500
check the downloads.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,440
Yes so to 44000 this right here if we say install that I'll install it.

112
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,010
Now watch down here.

113
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,590
We're in our virtual environment.

114
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:32,400
When I reload it knocks us back oh ok it also got rid of my other tab.

115
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,380
That was actually running the server.

116
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,140
OK.

117
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,750
So that's something that just sucks.

118
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,940
I wish I didn't do that but it does if I reload.

119
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,210
Our server is no longer running.

120
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,810
Now notice the Jinja syntax now has this this highlighting here.

121
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,390
Unfortunately if I knocked this down I would like it to be like that.

122
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,040
But if I save it gets put back up there.

123
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:06,970
So I think what I'm going to try is I'm going to go to my settings and let's set format on save to false.

124
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,440
Ok I always have this on true but I just want to save that and see if that helps the situation out.

125
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,110
So if I go down here and say OK so now it doesn't do that now since they shut that off.

126
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,140
I'm just going to have to be a little more aware of how my code is formatted.

127
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,170
OK.

128
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,910
But I think that with when we start to do like loops and stuff like that it's going to look really messy

129
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,900
if I keep that on.

130
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,160
So I think that I'm going to just shut that off.

131
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,900
All right so now we actually if you're following along and you just did what I did you have to go back

132
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,670
into your virtual environment so we're going to say source then.

133
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,580
So slash then slash then slash activate case.

134
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:05,130
Now back in and if you remember if you're in Windows it's going to be then slash scripts slash activate

135
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:05,980
dot.

136
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,410
That way you might have to do an absolute path.

137
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:18,820
So now I'm going to run my server with Python managed up-I run server so this is kind of the disadvantage

138
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:25,120
of using the integrated terminal with Django but you know I don't want to keep going back and forth

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,560
to my regular terminal.

140
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:27,850
All right.

141
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,640
So now my server is running so I'm going to open up another tab hit the plus sign here and just go into

142
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,770
my virtual environment and this tab as well.

143
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,300
And now we're back.

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,390
All right so if I go back to the browser and reload we should get our site back.

145
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,820
All right so in the next video I want to start to implement our bootstrap theme at least for the home

146
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,410
and the about page at first it's going to be all static content.

147
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,760
