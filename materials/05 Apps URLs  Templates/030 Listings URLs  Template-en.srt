1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,570
All right guys so now that we have our index in about page done as far as the display the UI I want

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,520
to create our listings app and also our realtor's app.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,890
Ok so once we do this we should have two new folders listings and realtors and it'll be similar to the

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:24,120
pages folder structure with all the admin dot by the apps models test your Elle's in views.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,610
Well actually you or else we create ourselves.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,260
So let's go ahead and generate these apps so we're going to say Python.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,230
Make sure you're in your virtual environment.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,130
We're going to say Python managed Daut pi.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,790
And we wanted to do start up and we're going to create an app called listings.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,950
OK.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,070
So now over to the left you can see it created a folder called listings lets do the same with realtors.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,440
OK.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,100
So Realtors is I mean listings obviously we have the listings page we have the single listing page and

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,820
all that stuff we have the search page thats going to be part of the listings app.

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,150
Realtors is more just for the model we're not going to have any templates or views for realtors.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:21,660
It's just to basically to be able to add realtors through the admin area and then basically form a relationship

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,480
between the realtor and the listing.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,810
OK so let's start off by adding our listings templates.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:37,160
So we're going to go into the templates and well let's create a special folder for listing templates

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,540
and call this listings.

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,300
And inside here we'll create a folder called listing agent team.

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,450
OK Cingular that's the single listing page.

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,250
We also want listings pleuro for you know the the the list of listings.

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,710
And let's also create one called Search page to mail.

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,950
OK so those are all the templates that we need now for listings we're going to have to have some some

26
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,290
your elves obviously that we need to connect to.

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,010
So that means we need to create its own you are Elle's dot.

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,310
So inside the the main listings folder here we're going to create a new file called you or else dot

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,160
PI and it's going to be similar to what we did with pages you are closed up.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,180
So I'm actually going to just copy that and bring that over to the new one here.

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:37,230
So we want to import path we want to import from views you are all patterns for just if we leave this

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,530
empty this pertains to slash listings or at least it will.

33
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,990
So we want that to call the index method inside of the listings views foaled views file.

34
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,020
OK and we'll name this listings OK.

35
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,140
Let's say for the single listings we actually want it to look like this so it will be our or whatever

36
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,820
are you are Ellas slash listings slash.

37
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,150
And then the ID like let's say listings 23.

38
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:18,910
So we need to include a parameter in our u r l here so it'll be slashy listings and then the ID.

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,160
So what we need to do is put in some angle brackets and we need to put the type that we want which is

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,770
going to be an int and then what we want to call it which is going to be listing underscore ID.

41
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,540
Okay so that'll be how we can actually access this parameter from within the view method.

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,470
So we'll have this go to views Daut listing that will be the name of the method and then the name will

43
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,580
call listing a singular and then the last you are all we're going to need here is going to be the search.

44
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:57,200
So we'll call this search and it will go to a method called search.

45
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,620
And as far as the the well we want it to be listings slash search.

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,610
So we just want to put in search here.

47
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,510
Okay.

48
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,770
And the reason we're not putting in like listings slash search here is because we're actually going

49
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,890
to link this to the main you are Elle's dot PI and tell it that anything that has listings slash should

50
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,740
look at this file so let's save this and we're going to now head over and we're going to get errors

51
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,340
here because we haven't created these methods yet.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,790
But let's head over to the main beat.

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,190
Sorry you are up high and we want to do the same thing we did with our pages app.

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,980
Okay.

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,360
And one other thing we have to do is at our apt to the settings file which I always always forget to

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,020
do.

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:49,960
So let's go ahead and just create another one here and this time we're going to do listings slash.

58
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:57,210
Okay so anything that is listing slash is going to go to listings.

59
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,000
You are Elle's.

60
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,590
So save that.

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,440
And then let's go to our setting's file.

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,010
Before I forget again.

63
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:12,820
So we'll go to settings up high and go up to where the apps are which are installed apps and let's copy

64
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,450
this down twice.

65
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:29,710
We want to bring in listings dot apps dot listings con thig and then we also want to bring in our realtors.

66
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,710
So so be realtors con fig it'll be realtors dot apps.

67
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,800
OK so I'll save that.

68
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,090
So now we need to create our view methods.

69
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:53,020
So are you Olsdorf for listings of index listing in search Scholtz create those who will go into views

70
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:05,430
and see we're going to get rid of that let's to define index so indexes are going to be just the main

71
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,830
listings page.

72
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:16,240
Okay this takes in a request and what we're going to do here is render the listings view.

73
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,790
So we want to render which has already brought in above passen the request and then the view we want

74
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:32,460
to render is going to be in the listings and it's going to be listings dot aged him out okay.

75
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:41,590
So now what I'll do is just copy this and paste that in let's do one more time so we have index we also

76
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,720
have just the listing.

77
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,800
And what I'm going by is this right here index listing and search.

78
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,700
So those those are the three methods that we want to create right now.

79
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,650
So listing in the template that will load is going to be listing aged all then we have search and that's

80
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,630
going to load the search aged HUMO.

81
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,400
Okay.

82
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,700
Now as far as the small pages for now it's just put h ones in there so will say this is listing.

83
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,080
I'll save that.

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,550
The Swan is listings.

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,670
Save that.

86
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,820
And then this one is search.

87
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,870
Save that.

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,690
OK.

89
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,840
Now if we try to save this Yarl's pie those errors go away.

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,780
OK let's just check on our server make sure that's still running.

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,050
Case that looks OK.

92
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,860
See what I have this open

93
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,640
I guess I can close one of these Kozo went up.

94
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:54,920
All right so now let's go to our application and let's try to go to slash listings.

95
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,300
OK so again error see page not found.

96
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,650
Why does it say about

97
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,750
see the mess something up here.

98
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:23,460
Let's check the route to you or else dot Pi so path listings slash include listings dot you are URLs

99
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,600
that should be right.

100
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:40,940
And then we have our listings app you are Elle's dot Pi which looks like this so views and its name

101
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,330
of listing so that looks all right.

102
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,950
And then we have our views

103
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,940
I you know let's

104
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,670
current path listings and match any of these

105
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:18,490
oh I have just listing the should have an S on the end try that.

106
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,460
OK so I get a different out of the view listings view index didn't return and HTB response object.

107
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,490
And that's because I didn't return the render.

108
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,650
So let's go back to views and make sure that we actually return these.

109
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,180
And I could edit this stuff out guys but I really don't like to because it's just real stuff.

110
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,180
It's stuff that happens in real life and I don't I don't like to talk fields and courses that are just

111
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:50,860
cookie cutter and it's not you know it's not it's not realistic to never forget something or make mistakes

112
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,510
or anything like that.

113
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,540
And it's important for new new developers to know that.

114
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,830
Let's save this and go back and reload and there we go.

115
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,340
Now we're loading our listings template now.

116
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,580
Remember we didn't extend the base HVM.

117
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,430
So that's why we're not seeing any of the bootstrap formatting or anything like that.

118
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,030
So let's let's do that.

119
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,610
Let's go to listings that age HTML.

120
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:28,240
And from here we want to extend the base HVM also it's got top and put in our tags and we'll say extends

121
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,460
based on age DML.

122
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,640
And then of course we need our block.

123
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,900
So I want to say block

124
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,270
content and right under that we want to end the block.

125
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,180
OK so now if we save that and go back and reload.

126
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,930
Now we have our crome.

127
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,850
Basically what do you mean by Crome is like our wrapper bootstrap wrapper.

128
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,820
OK so yeah we're just going to work on the listings page for now.

129
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I just want to get at least the static stuff here.

130
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:21,380
So what I'll do is go to my sublime text where I have just the theme and go to our listings our age

131
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,570
team and we want to grab everything that is under the nav bar.

132
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:34,290
So this section here all the way down to right above the Forder because remember the foot or the now

133
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,930
by that stuff is all included in a partial.

134
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:44,390
Inside the the main layout so we want everything down to the footer and then we'll go back to listings

135
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:52,050
on each team so we're just going to pace that stuff in here and let's save it and go back and reload

136
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,340
and there we go.

137
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,110
Now we're not going to see the images because the images are actually going to come from when we when

138
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,020
we go to the admin area and we upload a listing we're going to upload those.

139
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,170
We're going to upload some images and that's what we'll show here so I'm not going to mess around and

140
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,300
just you know put a static image here just for show it doesn't really matter right now.

141
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:21,060
OK but let's see what I do want to do is I want to add a link for this to go to home right now it's

142
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,710
going to go to index each team which obviously we don't want.

143
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,780
And then these should go to.

144
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,610
Right now they go to listing each time.

145
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,280
But we want these to go to the single listing page so it will be listings slash and then whatever the

146
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,090
idea is.

147
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,540
All right.

148
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,860
Well I guess we'll do that after because we don't actually have IDs yet.

149
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,290
So let's at least add to the breadcrumb link.

150
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:55,320
So we'll go up to see where is it his breadcrumb.

151
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,810
So right here

152
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,900
we're going to go play that.

153
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:10,990
We're going to say you are well and we want this to go to the home page which is in the index.

154
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,660
OK.

155
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,310
Now let me just try that real quick.

156
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:15,940
OK.

157
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,470
So that works.

158
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:26,800
Now when we when we create the database we create our listings model we create all of our tables and

159
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,620
stuff.

160
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,880
What we'll do is reach into the database past the listings into the view I'm sorry into the template

161
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,420
from the view or from the used up high and then we'll loop through the listings and output one of these

162
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,950
divs.

163
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,230
OK because right now we have a listing one listing to we're not going to need all of this markup.

164
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,650
We're only going to need to loop through listings and I'll put one of these and have dynamic you know

165
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,080
like the price will be dynamic it will be whatever the price for that current listing is and stuff like

166
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
that.

167
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,870
All right so this will be overall this will be a much smaller file and we're done same with with most

168
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,770
of the HMO stuff.

169
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,120
All right.

170
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:11,200
So let's see now what I want to do is I want this to actually go to the listings page.

171
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,610
So let's head over to the nav bar which is a partial.

172
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,790
So we want to go to templates Parshall's underscore nav bar.

173
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,450
And right now it goes to index.

174
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,570
I want to change that to listings.

175
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,600
Okay so that's that should now work let's try it out.

176
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,710
So if we reload this page and go to feature listings there we go.

177
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,440
Now we don't have it highlighted so we want to do the same thing that we did with the other ones.

178
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,740
So I'm going to copy this ally with the condition inside of it and I'm going to pace this is in place

179
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:54,820
of this ally like that and we're just going to test for listings can save that go back to reload and

180
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,390
now we have highlighted listings link.

181
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,670
All right cool.

182
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,760
So that's going to be it for this guys and we'll see you in the next one.
