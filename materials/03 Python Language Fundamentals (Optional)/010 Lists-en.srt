1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,090
All right guys and this video we're in it take a look at Lisse.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,360
OK so a list is a collection which is ordered and changeable and it allows duplicate members a list

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,490
is basically an array if you come from javascript or Pietsch P or many other languages.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,900
It's formatted just like an array and has a lot of the same array methods and stuff like that.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,230
So I going to create a variable here called numbers and let's do one two three four five OK and then

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:36,730
we'll go ahead and print it's actually print the types if I see print type numbers and we take a look.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,490
Whoops.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,260
Clearly so.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,010
And we're going to run Python 3.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,630
Let's stop pi.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,200
And you see class list.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:53,980
OK if I were to type out numbers itself or print out numbers itself it just prints out the list.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:01,250
So this is one way of doing it and this is the most common way let's say create a list but you can do

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,830
it another way and that's by using a constructor.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,260
So to do that you would do like numbers

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,660
and then we would do a list like that and then pass in another set of parentheses and put in our numbers.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,490
And if I were to comment so and save and run this you'll see the same thing.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,030
OK.

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,000
So just a different way of doing it but this is definitely the most popular way.

20
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,420
You don't see this all that much.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:40,700
So I'm actually going to create another array called fruits and going to set it to just a bunch of different

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,590
fruits so let's say apples

23
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,020
oranges

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,050
grapes and let's two pairs OK.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,590
So we have this fruit survey and we can do multiple types as well like if I wanted to put an integer

26
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,770
in here I could certainly do that just to show you that that's not going to like throw an error or anything.

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,230
OK.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,240
So I can do that.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,200
It's it's not like like go laying or anything like that.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,160
So we have this fruit's array.

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,520
Let's let's print out a certain index or a certain value.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,500
So let's say we want oranges just like with just about every other language.

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,920
Lists are raised there or they're all zero based So this is going to be 0 1 2 3.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:42,950
So all we have to do is print out and say we want oranges so say fruits 1 and run it and we get oranges.

35
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,830
It's a get value

36
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,230
OK if we want to let's say get the length of this list.

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:05,950
We could use the lende method just like we did with strings so we could say print when and then fruits

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,230
and it's going to give us the amount of values in that list so you can see we get four if we want to

39
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,710
append to this list.

40
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,830
We want to add something to it.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,090
So what we do is say fruits and in javascript we would do push right.

42
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,630
In python we do append.

43
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:36,650
So say fruit's append and let's say Mango's and then down here I just want to print fruits and let's

44
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,270
run this and you can see that now Mango's has been added.

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,920
All right if we want to remove something we can do that.

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:56,240
So let's say we're move from west so say fruit's dot remove and say we want to move grapes and then

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,260
I'll print it out and I can see that grapes is now gone.

48
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:10,730
If you want to insert into a specific position I'll say insert into position

49
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:26,720
we could say fruit's dot insert and let's say two and let's say strawberries OK let's see what that

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,170
gives us if we run it in now Strawberry's is in the two positions 0 1 2.

51
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,410
All right if we want to remove from a certain position

52
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,540
remove from position we can say fruits and we could use the pop method.

53
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,330
OK so let's say we want her removed from the third position and we run it.

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,760
Now we get apples oranges strawberries mangoes.

55
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,160
All right.

56
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,820
I forget what was there before what was it.

57
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,280
Grapes.

58
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,660
I don't know what whatever was in the third position they removed.

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,410
If we want to reverse the array

60
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,020
I said array and yet I'll probably do that over and over.

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,050
Call the call list an array.

62
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,550
So and I'll probably call Diksha a dictionary and object.

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,900
I mean that's that's the thing you can learn so many different languages because a lot of the concepts

64
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,000
are are very very similar.

65
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,310
All right arrays in Javascript in lists in Python are virtually the same thing.

66
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,420
I mean there's a couple of different methods that are named differently.

67
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,250
But you can do the same stuff so it's easy to learn but sometimes the terminology you get mixed up with.

68
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,510
At least I do.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:49,350
But let's go ahead and say fruit's dot reverse and go ahead and actually clear out and run it.

70
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,670
So now it's Mingos strawberries oranges apples.

71
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,410
So it's reversed.

72
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,680
Let's see if we want to sort it

73
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,160
we could say fruits Daut sort.

74
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,870
And now we get apples oranges strawberries.

75
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,180
Now it's ordered alphabetically.

76
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,600
If you want to reverse the sort you could simply say fruits.

77
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:28,510
Actually I'd say this is a comment or verse sort we could say fruits Daut sort.

78
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,480
And then simply pass in reverse.

79
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,380
Equals true.

80
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,920
And now we get it sorted alphabetically but it's reverse goes the other way.

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,420
All right guys so there's more methods in this if you want to look at the documentation you can do that.

82
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,460
But these are some of the really popular ones that you might find yourself using quite a bit.

83
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,470
So the next video I want to actually look at two things I want to look at something called tuples or

84
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,300
tuple and also something called a set.

85
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,540
OK so we'll get into that next.
