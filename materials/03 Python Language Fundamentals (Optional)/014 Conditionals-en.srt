1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,340
All right guys in this video we're going to look at conditionals if else statements which basically

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,610
are used to decide to do something based on a certain condition if it's true or if it's false.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,030
So as you can see here we have some comparison operators like is equal to is not equal to is greater

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,160
less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,700
And then logical operators like and or not we have membership operators like not not in.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,890
And then is is not what your identity operators.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,460
All right so we're going to just kind of look at the basics here so let's create a couple of variables

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,810
will do x is 10 y y is 6.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,310
And let's look at a simple IF statement.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,820
So I'm going to say if x and then the comparison operator I'm going to use as equals to our equals or

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,450
equal to.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,940
However you want to say it equal to Y and we want to put a colon so noticed that I didn't use parentheses.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,160
No curly braces this is the syntax for an IF statement in Python.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,900
And then of course we want to indent.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,310
OK here we're not inside the if statement.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,530
Here we are.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,670
So let's just do a print.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,220
And I'm just going to put an F string here so that I can take the variables that are above I'm going

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,950
to say x is equal to Y.

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,470
All right.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:30,090
Now if I run this with Python three conditionals dot pi we get nothing because this is this is not a

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,420
true statement.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,700
If I were to make it true and run it then of course would you get 10 equals 10 or 10 is equal to 10.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,530
So if we want to put in.

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:49,170
Else let's do a simple if else and use a different comparison operator let's do of x is greater than

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,540
Y then we'll go ahead and do a print.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:05,270
OK so we'll say x is greater than Y and ancy else and goes to a print and we're going to just change

28
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,530
this to less than

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,770
less than Y.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,140
All right.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,510
So let's save that and change the y back to 6 and run it.

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,280
So we get 10 is greater than 6 which is true.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,030
We change the Y to 16 then the else should run and we get sick.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,160
10 is less than 16.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,290
OK so that's a simple if if else.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,970
Now if you want to do more than one condition you can use and Aliff which is like an else.

37
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:45,220
If we could do like actually let's just copy this so you could copy that and then in between here we

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:53,680
could say Aliff and then another condition like x is equal to Y and then whatever we want to do we could

39
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:03,630
copy this print here and say x is equal to y.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,550
OK.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,290
So I'm going to comment this out and then run the file and we get 10 is less than 16 k if these were

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,180
to be equal then the this should run right here.

43
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,990
OK.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,450
So we get 10 is equal to 10 this this one is also running that's why you see it twice.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:33,610
And then let's see if X is less than the else should run this should run right here and we get 6 is

46
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,830
less than 10.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,330
OK we can also do nested IFs.

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,320
So they nested IF.

49
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:51,760
So if I wanted to say if X is let's say greater than 2 and then I wanted to keep going and say if X

50
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,360
is less than or equal to 10 then I wanted to do a print

51
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,670
K to make sure that this is indented correctly and will say let's see.

52
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,650
So X is less than 2 and greater than 10.

53
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,520
All right and X right now is 6.

54
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,340
So that should be fine for that to run let's comment this

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,890
OK so we get 6 is less than 2 and greater than 10.

56
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,120
All right.

57
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,060
Now this is kind of a poor way of writing this.

58
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,810
I mean this probably isn't something you would actually write anyways but if you were to do that you'd

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,640
be better off using it and logical operator.

60
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:49,710
So you could just do if x is greater than two and instead of nesting just simply put and X is less than

61
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,540
or equal to 10.

62
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,220
OK and then you could just take this.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,600
Put that in there.

64
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,450
All right so if we run this we should see it twice because it's running here and it's running here.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,070
OK but I'm going to comment these action when to copy this one because I want to show you we can also

66
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,400
do or not.

67
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:23,900
So I could do or and then would be X is less than 2 or greater than 10.

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,380
So basically if we do it this way only one of these only one has to match or be true.

69
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,380
In this case they both have to.

70
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,180
OK so that's the difference between and and or.

71
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,620
And this is just basic programming logic.

72
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,030
We also have not.

73
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:56,020
So we could do like if not and then pass in like let's say x is equal to Y and then we'll do print

74
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,590
and say F X is not equal to Y.

75
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

76
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,530
So it's clear the sauted run it and we get 6 is not equal to 10 which is a true statement.

77
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,040
All right so let's move on here I'm going to just comment this stuff out.

78
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,140
I know these are the most exciting examples.

79
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,650
Guys I just want just for the beginners that are just learning Python I just want you to get a grasp

80
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,470
of the basic syntax before we get started on the fun stuff.

81
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,560
So membership operators these are not and not in these are used for things like checking to see if something

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,610
is in a list.

83
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:56,740
So let's say numbers create a simple list here and let's say let's do in so we'll say if x in numbers.

84
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,720
So what this is going to do is it's going to look at the x value which is 6 and it's going to check

85
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,790
to see if it's in this list.

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,460
OK.

87
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:14,300
So if it is I'm just going to print x in numbers and this will actually give me a true or false statement

88
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,160
or true or false value.

89
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:24,010
So if we run this we get nothing because this in fact is false.

90
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:32,170
If I do or if we change let's actually add the 6 to the numbers that way it is in it.

91
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,510
So out of six.

92
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,230
And if we run this we're gonna get true because this right here evaluates to true.

93
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,810
We can do NOT in just like we can do in

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,010
K so I can say if x not in numbers come in.

95
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,010
So if I run this we're gonna get nothing because it is six is in numbers.

96
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,570
So this doesn't get a chance to run.

97
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:09,990
If I go ahead and get rid of the 6 and run it we get false because this actually equates to false.

98
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,570
All right hopefully that makes sense.

99
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,780
And lastly we have identity operators.

100
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,780
So I mean this is pretty simple it's just is or isn't like we could do.

101
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:36,870
If X is Y and will print X is Y.

102
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,140
I just want to comment this stuff for you guys.

103
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,370
So this is.

104
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,830
So right now these don't match.

105
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,770
Let's make a match and then when we run this we should get true because this will if this is true and

106
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,590
then what we're printing X is why this will actually give us a true value.

107
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,790
So we get true at the same time we can do is not.

108
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:10,140
So it is not.

109
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,540
And then I'll change the values so they don't match.

110
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,200
And now this should.

111
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,600
We want to do is not this should evaluate to true because X is not Y.

112
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,090
And there we go.

113
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,050
All right so I don't want to spend too much more time with this guys.

114
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,940
It's pretty basic stuff but it's also very important for you to know for you know how to format these

115
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,110
things.

116
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,710
So in the next video we're going to start to get into loops.
