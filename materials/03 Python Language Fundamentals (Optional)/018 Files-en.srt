1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,490
All right so as with most languages Python has methods for managing files creating them reading them

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,430
writing to them all types of stuff so I just want to take a look at some methods that we can use to

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,980
manipulate files.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,550
So first thing I want to do is open a file and it doesn't even have to exist.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,050
This will actually create it.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,030
OK so we're going to create a variable.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,990
Call it my file and let's set this to open case there's a method called Open where we pass in the name

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,840
of a file.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,170
I'm going to call it my file and it's going to be a text file.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,450
I want to be able to write to it.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,600
So we're going to pass in W and we can get some info on the file.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,200
Actually you know what.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:52,900
Let's just run this let's save this good out here and say Python 3 files dot PI and just by running

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,360
Now I notice that now I have my file Daut text case that actually created it.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,680
So we if we want to get some info on it we can do that and say get some info.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:15,170
Well go ahead and print out the file name so we can do that by saying my file Daut name OK if we want

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:23,120
to get see if it's closed say is closed.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:35,780
There's a method called closed and then the opening mode you have dot mode.

19
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,970
All right let's just see what this gives us if we run it.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,630
OK so we get name my file that text is close.

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,880
False opening mode w.

22
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:59,190
OK so basically when we open it it's it's it's ready for us to to to write into it or to add to it append

23
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,780
to it whatever.

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,520
Once we're done doing that we should we're supposed to close it.

25
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,280
So let me give you an example.

26
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,200
Let's say right to file.

27
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,420
So we'll take my file and I'll say dot right.

28
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,690
And then we'll pass in what we want to write.

29
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,740
I'll say I love Python and then we want to close it.

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,840
So we want to say my file

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,100
Daut close.

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,290
OK so let's save that and then let's clear this out and run it.

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,690
And let's go to my file Daut text and there we go.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,270
We actually wrote to the file using Python.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,010
Let's say we want to do this to another right.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Right here.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,230
And we'll add on to it.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,340
We'll say I love Python space and Javascript.

39
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,250
OK so let's run that.

40
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,570
So take a look at my file that text and we get.

41
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,310
I love Python and Javascript so you can continuously write to the file.

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,620
So let's see.

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,990
After it's closed Do we want to add to it.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,750
So let's say append two file case because now are pending to it.

45
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,840
So we're going to say my file equals open

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,670
it's my file Don t x t and we're going to put in a in here.

47
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,810
OK.

48
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,230
Because you want to append to it so.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,950
Because if we don't do that it's just going to overwrite it.

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,190
If we do what we did up here it's just going to overwrite what's already there and I want to keep this

51
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,940
in here and I just want to append to the end of it.

52
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,890
So that's why we're using the a a flag there.

53
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,590
So let's say my file Daut right.

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Even though we're doing dot right we opened it as a pen so it's not going to overwrite what's already

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,800
there.

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,810
So I'm going to put a space I'm going to say I also like ph.

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:17,990
OK.

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,730
And then after that we want to close it.

59
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,090
So I'll say my file thought close.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,790
All right.

61
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,380
So let's run this.

62
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,470
And let's take a look and you can see that it didn't just overwrite it if I put a W here.

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,300
Actually I can just show you that I put a W here.

64
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,550
And we go ahead and run it.

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,110
We we only get I also like each piece so if you want to append to a file and not overwrite it you want

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,920
to make sure you put in there.

67
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,890
So if we run that then it's back to how it was.

68
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,450
OK so if we want to read from a file

69
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:07,320
we can say my file equals open and we want my file X T.

70
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,870
Except this time we want to do r plus K because this time we're reading from it's own going to say tacksmen

71
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:23,450
to create a variable called text and that said it to my file Daut read and let's pass in 10.

72
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,190
OK.

73
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,100
Now when I print no text.

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Let's save this.

75
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,190
Clear this up and run it and you'll see what it does is it takes the first 10 characters of the file.

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,670
So that's what this is that's what this limit is if I put 100.

77
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,120
It's going to give us.

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,000
Well I mean there's not even 100 in here but it would give us the first hundred.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,770
All right so we're not going to really be doing much of this throughout the course.

80
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,410
I just wanted to show you that you know you can do this stuff.

81
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,930
You can create files.

82
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,880
Our particular jingle project doesn't really require us to do this.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,280
But again I just wanted to throw it in.

84
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,520
All right so in the next video I just want to take a quick look at working with Jason even though this

85
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,960
isn't really something we're going to do in the project either but it's always good to know how to work

86
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,050
with Jason because you know often you're working with third party API and stuff and Jason is the most

87
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,850
popular format so you want to know how to deal with that in Python.

88
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,540
All right so see in the next video.
