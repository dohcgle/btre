1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,530
All right guys so now I'm going to just give you a quick demo of the application will be building both

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,560
the front facing web site and the admin area.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,780
So this is the home page you can see there's a big search box here with some fields.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,110
I'm going to show you that in a second.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,870
That functionality we have the latest listings so whatever the latest three listings in the database

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,930
those will be placed here.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,220
Again we're using post-grads for a database down here is just some static markup with some services

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,020
and so on.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,360
And then on the About page we have some about data and then we have some realtors OK so the realtors

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,240
can get added in the admin area and they'll automatically be shown here and there's going to be a checkbox

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,490
for Celera of the month so we can choose that in the admin area and now whoever the seller of the month

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,700
will automatically show up right here.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,800
OK so some dynamic data on the About page.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,550
This is the listings page.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,880
So there's six listings total right now.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,650
If I were to add one more it would add some pagination down here.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,450
Right now I have it set to 6 per page.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,900
So we have the main image the price some other data if I click more info that takes us to the single

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,680
listing page where we have you know breadcrumbs you have the title up here or the address we have the

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,460
realtor.

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,730
So realtors and listings are going to have a relationship so that on the listings page we can access

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,700
any of that particular realtors information that we want.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,440
OK because the idea here is that each realtor will be assigned certain listings.

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,330
OK as you can see Cuyo Brown is the realtor for this listing here.

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,490
And we have a main image you have some smaller images that open up in a light box.

26
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,340
We're going to use something called light box 2 for this.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,980
And down here we have some data like the square feet the lot size the price description.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,720
We have to make an inquiry button if I click this it'll open up a modal.

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,640
Now if it were registered and logged in in the front facing Web site the name and email will be auto

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,580
populated from the database from that user.

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm going to show you that in a second.

32
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,410
OK but let's take a look at the search.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,680
OK so one of these has pool in the description.

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,290
So I'm going to search for the word pool and if I search you see we we go to this search results page

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,100
which has a form up here for we want to keep on searching and this is the result here.

36
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,800
So I'm going to clear that out.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,930
You can search by like bedroom's.

38
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,370
So if I choose three bedrooms what it's going to do is it's going to look for any house that has three

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,480
bedrooms or less.

40
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,930
OK so it's going to be less than or equal to.

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,240
So if I submit you'll see that all of these these have three bedrooms this one down here actually they

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
all of the bedrooms.

43
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,010
But if there were two bedroom or one bedroom it would also show that OK if I say four bedroom submit

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,120
and I can see the four bedrooms included as well.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,170
You can also go by price.

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,430
So it's two three bedroom and let's say four hundred thousand or less.

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,860
OK so that's how this is going to work.

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,580
Or less submit.

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,010
And we have to have one for two thirty one for 380 and they're both three bedrooms.

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,110
We can also search by state or city.

51
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:16,040
So let's say it's the this one's in Bedford so I'll say Bedford submit.

52
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,050
And there we go.

53
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,760
All right so the search is pretty simple it's not the most intuitive search in the world this isn't

54
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,170
Zillo dot com or anything like that but it's going to show you guys how to build query sets and how

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,540
to filter your data.

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,470
When you're when you're fetching from the database.

57
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,160
All right so now let's go ahead and register for an account case we have register and log in.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,370
I'm just going to create a user called Let's call him Bob.

59
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,570
Say Bob Johnson and username Bob.

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,460
Email

61
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,170
password and let's register.

62
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,800
OK so we get a little message we're going to use Jango messages and kind of format them with bootstrap.

63
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,060
We also added a little bit of Javascript so that it disappears after three seconds so let's log in with

64
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:14,400
Bob case that takes us to a dashboard we get rid of this tells us we're logged in the message disappears

65
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,660
and the dashboard is basically just a list of any inquiries that you've made.

66
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,240
OK.

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,660
And up here you can see it says welcome in our username dashboard so obviously these links change once

68
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,980
you're logged in.

69
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,060
If I go to feature listings and let's say say were interested on this property make an inquiry and notice

70
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,760
that the name and the e-mails are already in here.

71
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,900
OK if you want you can put a phone number and message as well but that's optional.

72
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,500
So when I say send we get a success message saying they'll get back to us if I try to make another request

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,970
on the same property.

74
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,030
We're going to get an error saying we've already made that request.

75
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,120
OK so we're going to have that functionality if we go to the dashboard you'll see the Essex circle.

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,890
That's the one that we just made the inquiry to.

77
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,870
And if I say View listing it will take us to that listing.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,710
OK.

79
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,280
So let's I want to inquiry for this one.

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,190
It could send and go to a dashboard and we'll see that here.

81
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,430
So that's the front end functionality.

82
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,810
Now let's take a look at the admin side.

83
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm going to go to slash admen.

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,950
It's going to tell us to log out because Bob is not a staff user or are not logo but log in here with

85
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:32,940
an admin user so I'm going to put in my brad user which is the admin and you can see that we've customized

86
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,730
the colors to match the branding.

87
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,640
We've added the logo up here.

88
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,780
If we go to this site just see groups and users this is just standard Django functionality that's there

89
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,770
by default all your users and stuff like that.

90
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,630
But you can see we have realtors listings and contacts.

91
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,020
OK so any inquiries that are made will be put in contacts.

92
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,990
All of our listings are here and we can also choose to unpublished them.

93
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,550
OK this is not standard Gengel functionality we added this field is published in the database.

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Let's say the United road we want to unpublished that I could uncheck and save.

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:20,210
And if we go back to the front facing Web site now we'll go to featured listings and you can see that

96
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,920
one.

97
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,670
What was that.

98
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,490
That was a United road you'll see it.

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,990
That one is now gone.

100
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,930
OK so we can publish an unpublished really easily if we go to one of these forms you'll see we can choose

101
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,760
a realtor.

102
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,760
So there's a relationship between the realtor and the listings.

103
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,460
We can upload images for the main image.

104
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,890
These are for the other ones published list state and so on.

105
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:53,710
And then if we go to realtors you know see we have Jenny Mark Kyle and if I go to Jenny notice that

106
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,450
is MVP is checked.

107
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:04,330
So I'm going to uncheck that and save and go to Mark Hudson and check is MVP and save and if we go to

108
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,140
the About page.

109
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,330
Now notice that Mark Hudson is now a seller of the month.

110
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,220
OK.

111
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,730
And whatever realtor you add is going to show up down here on the About page.

112
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,640
So that's that's pretty much it guys as far as the functionality.

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,700
So we're going to go through this course in a very just just practical manner as I would if I were building

114
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,150
this for a client.

115
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,230
You know so hopefully you enjoy it.

116
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,710
And let's get started.
