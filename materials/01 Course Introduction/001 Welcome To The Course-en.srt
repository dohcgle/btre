00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,700
The

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,270
Hey Guys welcome to Python Django dev to deployment so in this welcome video I just want to give you

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,860
an idea of how this course is structured so that you know exactly what to expect.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
And it's it's formatted a bit differently than some of my other courses.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,210
This is strictly a project based course.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,990
It's not a linear like documentation type video course with slides and all that.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,230
We're going to look at this as a practical project that was given to us by a fictional company called

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,140
Beati real estate and they want us to build them a Web site or a web app where they can add their property

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,960
listings.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,100
They can have people search browse make inquiries and add their realtors and stuff like that.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:53,970
So we're going to go from the point of you know absolute scratch starting with installing Python setting

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,480
up a virtual environment setting up vs code and then diving into Django.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,890
OK we're not going to build the bootstrap theme in this course because I want to focus on just Django

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,660
but I have it all packaged and ready to implement into the project so it'll be included in your course

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,530
files.

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,260
Now at some point I will be doing probably a YouTube series on the travesty media channel where we actually

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,470
build the theme from scratch using bootstrap and SAS.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,400
But like I said I didn't want to put that in this course.

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,910
I might change my mind later and put it in but for now we're just going to I use the package theme now

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,840
for requirements.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,360
All you really need to know is basic HTL CSSA and some programming principles like you know if statements

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,700
and functions and stuff like that if you've if you've used any other language like javascript or PSP

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,700
or anything like that you should be fine.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,200
We're actually going to have a section where we go over the Python syntax.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,580
We go over like lists and dictionaries and functions.

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,590
The indentation syntax and all that stuff.

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,970
So you should be absolutely fine even if you've never used Python before.

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,450
And Django is a very very high level framework meaning that there's there's really only one way to do

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,750
pretty much everything it's not like like some frameworks like flask for instance which is a micro framework

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,750
where you can do things the way you want with Gengel you have some specific rules to follow which makes

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,780
it a little easier to learn.

32
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,670
All right so after you take this course you'll be able to build your own Django apps.

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,310
You're going to learn about set up templates view methods you URLs and routes forms models migrations

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,090
and much more.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,700
OK we're going to be using post-grads as our database will also deploy to Digital Ocean using unicorn

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,450
and engine next to proxy.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,310
So if you're interested in building this project stick around.

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,070
In the next video I'm going to go over the whole application and show you what what it entails.
