1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,660
All right guys so in the last video we created a virtual environment so we have a folder called mind

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,150
B-tree project.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,180
And then my virtual environment is called wiii envy and to activate that on a Mac we do source and then

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,380
we do go into our Wii and Wii folder and then bin and then activates.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:21,950
OK.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,210
And on Windows it's going to be the envy source slash activate dot bat.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,620
And you don't put the source in front of it.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,560
OK.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,990
So now that we're inside the environment we know that because of this right here we want to install

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,760
Django.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,110
OK.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,900
So if we do a pip freeze right now you can see there's nothing there.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:53,220
So let's do a pip install Django OK and this is only going to install it inside of our environment.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,620
That's the beauty of this is it doesn't install it globally.

15
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,190
It's just in our environment.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:05,020
So now if I do a pip freeze you'll see we have Django and it's dependency of Pi Z.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,410
All right.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:16,660
Now to to create a Django project we want to run Hey want to use a special Selye program called Django

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,510
Admin..

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,700
So if we say Django Dasch admin help you'll see that we have a bunch of different commands Harry of

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,130
stuff to deal with like migrations in the database ask you all stuff start app now.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,370
I'm going to explain this a little more but Django has it has a project entity which is like your main

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,060
project and then apps.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,320
OK so you have one project which is which is essentially your your main application.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,980
In our case it's our real estate application but it's called a project.

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,970
And then inside that you have apps like we're going to have listings app for our property listings.

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,080
We're going to have a realtor's app for our realtors OK so stuff like that.

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,580
I'm going to explain more of that as we move along.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,840
Now the command that we're interested in here is start project.

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,260
Okay so that's going to create a project for us.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:21,810
So let me clear this out and let's run Django dash admen and we want to run start project and I'm going

32
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,000
to call I'm just going to call it free.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,970
And then just put a dot for the current directory and let's run that.

34
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,780
And then up here you'll see what it's created.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,220
It created the BTR folder with some files and I'm going to go over these files in the next video.

36
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,860
But it also created a managed pie.

37
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,760
Now this managed up pie we're never going to touch this code here.

38
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,260
This this is basically the tool we're going to use now instead of Django admen.

39
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,850
OK.

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,550
It has.

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,310
Actually if we do Python and you always need to run it with Python.

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,530
So Python managed PI help.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,740
You'll see a lot of the same commands that Django admin has only it's more localized to this project

44
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:10,030
so we're always going to use managed up-I when doing like migrations run server will run our Python

45
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,160
server.

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,520
Create creates super user will create a user for our admin area.

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,520
So we're going to be using managed up-I quite a bit.

48
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:29,450
OK so now I want to address something that that mostly has to do with if you're using VS code so you

49
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,250
can see this little pop up down here of Linter Pioline it is not installed.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,310
So you may have some issues if you use the Linter because it doesn't always recognize your virtual environment.

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,920
So you might get like inport errors said because it thinks that Django isn't installed because it's

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,090
looking at your global environment to fix this what usually works is you want to open up your command

53
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:03,910
palette with shit shift command P or shift control P and you want us to go to our search for Python

54
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,140
and you want the select interpreter OK.

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,530
And in that interpreter you should have your VTR in virtual environment and that's what you want to

56
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,790
use so I'm going to choose that.

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:23,950
And you should also be in your virtual environment here or in your command line whatever you're using.

58
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,350
All right.

59
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,620
And then once you do that you can go ahead and click install here if you want.

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:36,810
You can also disable it but I'm going to click install and now the the Linter should only be installed

61
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,680
in my virtual environment.

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:46,830
And also notice up here we have a special vs code config for the settings and the Python path is now

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,870
pointed to our virtual environment Python path.

64
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,380
OK.

65
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,600
Or location.

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,320
So now our lending should work correctly even if we're in our virtual environment.

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,110
All right so we're going to clear that up.

68
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,120
And now if I open up a python file I'm just going to open this up and now you shouldn't get that pop

69
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,830
up again.

70
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,840
If you do that means that you haven't selected the correct interpreter via your virtual environment

71
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,880
interpreter.

72
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,840
All right which should create this setting's file that I just showed you.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,550
I know I can get a little complicated if you're having trouble you can you can post in the Q&amp;A and either

74
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,360
myself or someone else else can try to help you.

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,070
But I would suggest doing a quick Google search and you'll probably find the answer it's there's there's

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,880
a lot of information about this.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,060
Now the last thing I want to do here is just initialize it get repositories so I would highly recommend

78
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,970
that you use get version control.

79
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,860
I'm not going to be doing my commits stuff on screen and you guys can do you know commit whenever you

80
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,070
want but I would suggest using it.

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,740
So if you don't have get installed you can either you can go to get dash SVM dot com I believe or dot

82
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,570
org.

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,230
Just search for get and then.

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,850
Or you can use like homebrew or if you're on Linux you can use your package manager whatever.

85
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,310
And then just do a get in net.

86
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:16,120
Cases that initialiser get repository and then let's create a new file in the root here called Daut

87
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,780
get ignore.

88
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,700
OK.

89
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,130
And what this does I know a lot of you guys know this but what this does is it allows you to add stuff

90
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,300
that you don't want to be pushed to or get repository would see what does this say has too many active

91
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,590
changes.

92
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,290
I don't want to see that but yeah.

93
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,350
So whatever you put here won't be pushed to the repository.

94
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,360
Now when you're dealing with a new framework it can be kind of difficult to know what you're supposed

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920
to push and what you're not.

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,070
So what I would recommend doing is using an awesome Web site called Get ignore dot I O.

97
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,620
And basically you can just pass in the name of a framework or anything at all and it will give you like

98
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,390
a default good ignore file.

99
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:08,270
So let's say Django even has a little pop up and you can search multiple ones as well but let's just

100
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,010
for Django and it gives us kind of a default good ignore file that we can use.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,310
I'm just going to grab this.

102
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,550
We're going to copy this and go over and paste that in.

103
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,770
And these are just comments we can get rid of these OK.

104
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,720
Now one thing I'm going to add here.

105
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,700
When you get rid of this as well I mean you can keep the credits if you want but I'm going to get rid

106
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,550
of all the comments.

107
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,330
But one thing I'm going to add here is the virtual environment because I have that in in this this file

108
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,810
or in this folder so I don't want that being pushed.

109
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,980
So I'm going to put a van or whatever you called that folder.

110
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,600
You should also put in there.

111
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,250
OK.

112
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,760
So let's go ahead and save that and I'm just going to do my initial commit here but unlocking it like

113
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:06,130
I said I'm not going to be doing all my commits on camera so I'm just going to say Get add all and get

114
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:17,170
commit and he's going to say and this show will just say initial comment in case that's now pushed to

115
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,070
my local repository.

116
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,830
All right.

117
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,170
And we're going to be using get at the end to actually deploy to push to Digital Ocean or to get hub

118
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,680
and then pull to digital oceans so you definitely want to get it installed.

119
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,810
All right so that's it in the next video we're going to go through some of these files here and talk

120
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,740
about what they are what they do and I will see you then.
