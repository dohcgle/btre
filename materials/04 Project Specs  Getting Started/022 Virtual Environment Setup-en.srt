1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,390
All right guys so before we start to actually install Django and work with stuff we want to create what's

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,210
called the virtual environment in Python.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,600
And you want to do this because you want to keep all your packages and dependencies and all that isolated

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,680
inside of your project rather than in the global scope.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,880
OK and this is a documentation page for Python 3 and this is the creation of virtual environments.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,890
And before version 3.6 you actually had to use you to install a package with Pipp called Virtual ENVI

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,760
there's some other ones as well.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,250
But now with Python 3.6 and hop you can just use the actual V and V package it's included with Python

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,010
2 to create your environment.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,660
So you would run Python 3 or something.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,670
Or if Python is Python 3 like on Windows for example you would just use Python and then dash MVP envy

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,600
and then whatever path you want to create that that virtual environment.

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,750
OK so I'm going to be using my visual studio text editor.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,000
But before I get into that I just want to create a project and open it inside vs code.

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,490
So I'm in my home folder.

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,760
I do have a whip's folder called dev that's where I want to create my projects and get a CD into dev

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,330
and of course you guys can create your project wherever you want.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,790
But I'm going to go ahead and do a make directory.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,730
I'm going to call this project b t r e underscore project.

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,800
OK.

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,890
And then we're going to see D into b t r e underscore project.

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,340
And here's where I'm going to open my text editor so we're going to say code Daut that's going to open

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,060
up vs code inside that directory.

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,730
All right and if you're not using VS code just go ahead and open up your textedit are inside this directory.

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:02,310
All right so now I'm going to open up my integrated terminal I'm going to use this instead because this

26
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,460
is going to be using this throughout the course.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,420
So if I were to do.

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,030
Let's see.

29
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,240
So we have we have PIP and we have PIP 3.

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,090
I'm going to say Pip three frees.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,080
And what this shows us is basically the packages in.

32
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:27,980
And you know dependencies that are installed on a global scope on our system and we don't want this

33
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,170
we want to have we want to have our own environment for this project.

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,320
And I don't want like beautiful soup and all this other stuff included in that project environment that

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,700
virtual environment.

36
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,240
So let's go ahead and create a virtual environment now if you're on Windows or Mac or Linux.

37
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,730
The creation of the virtual environment should be virtually the same.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,990
But to activate it is a little different so I'm going to show that you know the people on Windows how

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,960
to do it after how to activate it after but to create it it should be the same it should be Python whatever

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,440
your Python 3 is if you are on Windows and Python is Python 3 Like just do a dash dash version if it's

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,810
Python 3 then use that.

42
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,060
If not then you want to use Python 3.

43
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:25,020
And then we're going to say just like the documentation dash em and then VI envy and then wherever you

44
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,160
want to create this this V.N. the folder.

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,540
OK.

46
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,060
And you can call it whatever you want.

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,690
I like to just call it V and V and I want it in the current project directory.

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,930
So I'm going to say dot slash wiii envy.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,970
And that's that's it that's where I want to put this.

50
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:47,010
I'm going to go ahead and run this OK and then notice up here.

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,360
It's actually created a folder called wiii envy.

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,870
Now if you're on Windows it may look a bit different.

53
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,810
You're going to have a folder called scripts with an uppercase ass and inside scripts you'll have an

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,740
activate dot batch file.

55
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,530
Ok on a Mac you'll have a bin folder with an activate file.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,910
So that's where it kind of differentiates and how you activate.

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,690
Because right now we just created the environment we're not actually in it.

58
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,230
If I do a pip freeze we still see all that stuff.

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,550
So we're not we're not currently in that directory.

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,150
So I'm sorry in that environment.

61
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,260
So to activate that environment we want to on a Mac OK so this is on a Mac I'll do windows after.

62
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:39,250
We want to do source and then we want to just point to one source and then point to that folder so we're

63
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,580
going to say current directory dot slash and then wiii and VI.

64
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,430
OK.

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,850
And then we want to go to slash Ben and then slash activate.

66
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,040
OK that'll run the Activate script.

67
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,360
OK once I do that.

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,650
Notice that before my computer name here we have the ENVI inside parentheses.

69
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:58,980
All right.

70
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,480
So now we're inside of our virtual environment.

71
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,580
Now watch this if I do.

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,990
Just Python dash dash version remember was version 2 before.

73
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,370
Now it's 3.7.

74
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,840
So from now on when we're in our virtual environment we don't need to run Python 3.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,240
Ok Python is going to is going to be Python 3 from now on.

76
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,190
So no more Python 3 no more Pipp 3 as long as we're in our virtual environment.

77
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,350
OK because we created this virtual environment with Python 3.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,500
All right so now to leave the environment we want to say D activate.

79
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,290
OK that's it just deactivate.

80
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,350
And now we're out.

81
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,490
Now if I do a python dash dash version the global version is 2 for that.

82
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,570
So now we would have to do Python 3 for anything Python 3.

83
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,700
All right so now let me show you how to activate it in Windows.

84
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:59,410
Now when you created it like like where it's like this if if it didn't work for some reason do the absolute

85
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:09,370
path here instead of dot slash go like if you're on Windows like C you know C slash users slash whatever

86
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,860
your user name is wherever you put this V in the folder.

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:25,040
OK try that and then to activate it in Windows you want to do Python and then you want to go dot slash

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,940
V and the slash.

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,140
Actually no you don't need to even do Python.

90
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:38,160
I don't believe so just the and the slash and then instead of been you want to go into scripts and then

91
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,650
you want to do activate dot that.

92
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,160
OK so that should run your virtual environment if you're on Windows.

93
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,200
OK.

94
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't believe you need the python.

95
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,070
If that doesn't work you can try it.

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Also if this doesn't work try an absolute paths so start at your what C or whatever drive you're on

97
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,590
and then navigate to the V V V folder.

98
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,130
All right so try that.

99
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,400
If you're on Windows and that should get you into the virtual environment.

100
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,760
All right so I'm going to go ahead and activate my virtual environment again with this right here.

101
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,390
All right.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,500
And if I do a pit freeze nothing goes so I have nothing installed in this particular environment and

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,550
that's what we want.

104
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,520
And then when we install Django it'll get installed in this environment if we deactivate the environment

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,950
it won't be installed in the global scope.

106
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,170
All right so hopefully that all makes sense and hopefully you're in your environment.

107
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,070
Hopefully you see this right here and in the next video we're going to install Django.
