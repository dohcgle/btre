1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,520
All right guys so I just want to quickly go over the bootstrap theme that we'll be using K so through

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,420
throughout the course we'll be plucking things out of this theme.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,400
You know the HVM will be putting in two templates in Django but I wanted to go over it and I will be

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,930
doing a tutorial on how to create this theme from scratch.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,010
And that's probably going to be on my YouTube channel when that happens.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,410
I will add a note to the course if you guys are interested on actually building the theme.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,320
I didn't want to include it in the course because it would be too much focus on bootstrapping aged team

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,220
Tim Allen CSSA and that's not what this course is about.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,600
So a lot of times on a team you'll get handed something like this.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,610
You know if you're if you're the back and the Django developer you'll get handed this and you'll turn

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,130
it into a real application.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,000
OK so if we look over here you'll see a disk folder that's where all of the team pages are all of the

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,620
compiled assets like the CSSA all the boots decompiled bootstrap and stuff like that.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,740
But also notice that we have a SPSS folder I use SAS in this project in this theme because I wanted

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,100
to really customize the bootstrap colors.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,830
So I do these all these underscore files here are part of the bootstrap SAS that comes in the source

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:25,350
code and they edited the variables to match the the branding colors so like they're blue and green and

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,500
stuff like that.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,860
So that's why you use Sassa also have a style dot SPSS file with all the custom styles.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,460
So the Parshall's the underscores they don't get compiled.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,640
The only two files here that get compiled into regular CSSA is going to be style and bootstrap.

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,720
OK so if we look at are deceitful there and we look ans assets CSSA you'll see the compiled styles file

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,300
compiled style file and the bootstrap VSS.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,500
OK and this is the custom bootstrap CSSA file with those custom colors.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,770
Now this all got CSSA is actually font.

26
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,500
Awesome.

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,240
OK I'm including everything locally I'm not doing any CD ends or anything.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,140
So if there's like bootstrap 5 or 6 out by the time you watch this you have everything here and there's

29
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,620
no need to use a later version and then have to go and change classes and stuff like that.

30
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,640
So I'd highly recommend using all of these files.

31
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,230
I even included Jay query locally so you can see we have Jay query here.

32
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,580
Now you might be wondering what this light box is.

33
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,890
So we have a light box CSSA and Javascript.

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,240
This is actually from something called light box 2 which is the solution we're going to use for the

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,910
listing page for the light box.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,060
No we want a light box too.

37
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,020
And it's this right here.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,570
And I can give you an example.

39
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,060
So the reason I chose this is because it looks nice and because it allows us to do sets.

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,520
So if I click on this image here I can actually scroll through a set of images and that's exactly what

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,770
we needed for the requirements.

42
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,840
Remember when we looked at the document it said we needed to be able to scroll through all the listing

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,560
images.

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,350
So this is a great solution for that.

45
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,270
So that's also included in the theme.

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,680
All right.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,720
So if we want to take a look at what this looks like you can either open up an aged him file or what

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,990
I'm going to do is use an extension that I have in vs code called Live server.

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,930
So say open with live server.

50
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,930
And here's the home page.

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:36,120
OK so basically we have the top bar here with the contact and social stuff we have now bar with the

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,240
logo home about listings register log in.

53
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,630
We have the main search with the main background image five fields.

54
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,330
Now we have the three latest listings.

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,620
OK so we have the the image the price.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,420
Address some of the some of the specs here like the bedrooms and bathrooms the realtor.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,000
How long ago it was posted.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,030
Stuff like that.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,090
And then just the services area just a static you know icons and text and then a simple footer.

60
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,600
OK so that's our home page.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
Take a look at about.

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,260
So about all the inner pages have this kind of a title format so you can see they all have that with

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,680
the background building image and stuff.

64
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,160
We have breadcrumbs on the site so that we can navigate easy.

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,620
Home page is very simple.

66
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,930
We have the seller of the month.

67
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,440
Remember this needs to be controllable by the at through the admin area and then any realtors we add

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,930
in the admin area should show up here as well.

69
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,480
So this should be dynamic.

70
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,270
This shouldn't be just statically you know placed in the template.

71
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,710
All right now the listings page will look like this.

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,050
So we'll have six per page and then we need to have pagination and we also need to style that pagination.

73
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,110
We want it to look like this and then it had this.

74
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,030
These are basically just like the featured or the the latest listings on the home page.

75
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,500
So if I click more info it takes a single listing and this is the main image we have all those smaller

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,760
images with the light box.

77
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,660
OK so the light box is already implemented.

78
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,590
We just need to make the images the source come from the database.

79
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,360
OK.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,070
And then we have all the fields we have the description the realtor.

81
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,950
OK so we'll be connecting realtors to the listings and then an inquiry motile so people can make inquiries

82
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,440
if they're logged in their name and their email should already be filled in here because we already

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,740
have that information in the database.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,600
Then we have the search page.

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,090
So if I just submit this form it'll take us to search each team.

86
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,100
And basically the same as the listing page except it has the search fields appear in case you want to

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,290
keep searching.

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,230
And then let's say we have the register page which is very simple log in and then the dashboard which

89
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,380
I don't think we can get to from here so I'm just going to type in Dashboard daughter aged him now and

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,770
this is just where you can see your inquiries.

91
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,900
OK so if you made an inquiry to a listing it'll show up here and you can view the listing if you want.

92
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,370
OK.

93
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,560
And if you're logged in look like like this the requirements said if you're logged in and you already

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,660
made an inquiry and you try to make another one it shouldn't go through what should say you've already

95
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,860
made an inquiry.

96
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,410
So that's part of the requirements.

97
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,090
All right so that's basically what the the theme looks like.

98
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:34,200
So throughout the project we'll be plucking stuff out and putting it into templates and having you know

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,580
we'll be using the Jinja template system to make it dynamic.

100
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,300
And if you want to check out all the h t mail you can do that.

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,450
So it's pretty it's pretty clean pretty semantic.

102
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,380
We use section and header and footer and NAV and all that stuff.

103
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:49,730
All right.

104
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,890
So that's it guys in the next section we're going to get started on Django.
