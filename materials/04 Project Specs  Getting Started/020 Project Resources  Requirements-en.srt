1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,950
All right guys so we're going to kind of look at this project as if it were an actual application we're

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,160
building for a client.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,690
OK so for our client is Beati real estate and they want an application where they can you know have

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,200
a basic web site but also have the ability to have an admin area where they can add their listings they

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,150
can add their realtors they can connect realtors to listings and all that stuff.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,630
So we have a folder here and you have this in your project files called Beati our resources and we're

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,180
going to take a look at what that folder includes.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,680
OK.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,920
So it has a couple of things that has an app requirements doc that basically gives us all the specifications

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,970
and requirements for this project.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,900
We have an images folder with all the images.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,980
We'll take a look at their logo.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,390
And then we have their theme.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,940
OK so in the next video we're going to actually dive in and take a look at the whole theme.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,560
So it's basically the the Web site with no functionality.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,340
OK.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,470
So let's start off with looking at the logo.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,510
Ok so very simple logo.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,030
We're going to be using the white version on the Web site and then we also have a dark version.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,230
Actually let me put this in a different view.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,960
Let's do let's go like that.

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,660
All right so we actually have a couple of files to have a CD which is a photoshop file.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,990
Don't worry if you don't have photoshop it's it's just a resource.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,500
We're not editing their logo or anything.

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,590
This is the logo PNB G which is the white version and then we have the dark version.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,200
OK so in addition to logo we have images and there's a couple for subfolder is one site.

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,970
And if we look in here we have the showcase image which is like the main the main image on the home

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,630
page.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,290
Then we have a building Jay Pegge which you can use as a background image which mode which is used as

30
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,510
a background image in the theme and then the about image which goes on the About page.

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,300
All right.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,790
And then we have realtors.

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,490
So here we have their team.

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,170
Basically it's a three person team.

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,530
Jenny Kyle and Mark.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,580
So we have images of them.

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,930
Those will go on the About page we have.

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,080
And we already looked at that.

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,280
We have homes.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,330
So these are the actual listing images.

41
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,350
So they have six homes that we need to add and then we have the home inside one through six.

42
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,020
These are just inside photos and we're just going to use these as the inside for all the homes as opposed

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,950
to me having six different images for every home.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,350
OK so those are the images.

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,930
Now let's take a look at the app requirements document.

46
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,120
And this is just a doc file so you'll be able to view it in Windows or Mac or Linux.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,410
So basically this would be like either what the client sends us or what I would suggest is if you're

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,520
dealing directly with clients is to sit down with them and get the exact requirements specifications.

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,240
So you know what you're doing and you guys are on the same page and they don't try to you know say well

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,100
are you supposed to do this or supposed to do this.

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,280
And they didn't pay for that so you need to come to a mutual understanding of what actually goes into

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
the projects.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,860
OK.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
So we have some front pages here.

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,460
These are the pages we need to create.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,950
Again we have the theme already made for us and we'll just pretend that was created by a designer or

57
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,790
whatever.

58
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:29,350
But we have a home page about page listings single listing search register log in and dashboard.

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:38,610
OK as far as the design specs which are already taken care of with the theme we have the BTR logo that

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,110
is to be used on the front end and admin.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,460
OK.

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,850
When I say front end I just mean the front facing web site and then the admin area then branding colors

63
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,300
so they have certain blue and green.

64
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,080
These are the hexadecimal values.

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,670
It's mobile friendly responsive and social media icons and contact info should be clearly displayed

66
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,360
and it doesn't have to be fancy but must be clean so that the design specs as far as the functionality.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,180
This is the stuff that we have to actually make happen because right now we're just going to have an

68
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,610
empty theme that doesn't do anything it's just the UI.

69
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:22,530
All right so they want to be able to manage listings realtors contact inquiries and Web site users through

70
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,790
their admin area.

71
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,370
So they should be able to create read update and delete all of these things here and then roll base

72
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,850
users.

73
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,410
So this means that some of the users should be able to be staff and some not.

74
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,180
So most would not but there should be some staff users that can access the admin area display listings

75
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,550
and app with pagination.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,700
OK so they do want pagination as opposed to just having a never ending page of listings.

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:56,820
Ability to set listings to unpublished so we'll have to figure out a way to have like a checkbox where

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,210
they can either publish or unpublished a listing that show on the front end search listings by keywords

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,910
city state bedrooms and price so those are the fields that need to be searchable.

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,570
Some will be input boxes some will be select lists and the search should be on the home page as well

81
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,000
as on the search page.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,780
OK list realtors on a boat page with seller of the month control via adman's So they want to be able

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:30,910
to add and manage realtors in the admin section right while they want these realtors to also be displayed

84
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,550
on the above page.

85
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,900
OK.

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
So we have to do that.

87
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,310
And then they want an option of seller of the month.

88
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:44,130
So what we'll do is create a checkbox inside the admin area for Selar of the month and if that seller

89
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,890
or that retailer has checked off the no show on the About page as seller of the month.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,290
OK we also have listing page should have fields listed below.

91
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:00,160
Meaning these down here we'll take a look at those in the second listing page should have 5 5 images

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,670
with lightbox.

93
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,320
I believe it's actually 6.

94
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,190
But we'll we'll get to that.

95
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,390
So a light box just means you know they want thumbnails and we should be able to click on it and then

96
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:16,360
have a box open up that shows the larger image and then this next one light box should scroll through

97
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,210
images.

98
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,600
So they want to be able to like have an arrow that we can click and just scroll through all the images

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,970
for that listing.

100
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,550
OK listing page should have a form to submit an inquiry for that listing.

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,170
So they want every every single listing page should have a form where they can put their name and email

102
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,690
and contact info and stuff like that.

103
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,730
All right.

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,320
And that form should go to the database.

105
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,010
It should also notify the realtors with an e-mail.

106
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:52,870
OK so we need to set up some kind of e-mail system so front and register log in to track inquiries meaning

107
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,150
that users should be able to register on the from the front end web site not as a staff member not as

108
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,330
an admin user but a regular user and they can log in and if they make any inquiries about a property

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,970
then they should be able.

110
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,320
That will be displayed in their dashboard on the front end.

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,960
OK.

112
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,140
And then both unregistered and registered users can submit a form meaning an inquiry if the if they're

113
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,630
registered in law then they should only be able to submit one per listing.

114
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:21,990
OK.

115
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,240
Meaning if they're logged in and they submit to let's say you know 55 main street and they try to submit

116
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,060
another one for 55 Main Street.

117
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,690
It should say you know you've already submitted an inquiry for this property.

118
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,440
So these are the basic fields they want on the listing page title address.

119
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,650
Most likely the title will be the address.

120
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,660
But we want the ability to choose something else if they want price.

121
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,950
Bedrooms bathrooms square feet lot size.

122
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,320
How many garages.

123
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,930
The listing date the Realtor of that property meaning their name and their image and then a main image

124
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,030
in five other smaller images with a white box.

125
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,270
OK impossible future functionality.

126
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,130
Google Maps on listing page and Beier testimonial.

127
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,040
So this is stuff that's not going to be in the course currently but I might add later on.

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,670
All right so these are all the specifications for the application.

129
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,410
So in the next video we're going to take a look at the theme and that will give us an even better idea

130
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,220
of what we're doing here and what it's going to take to to make this happen.
