1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,690
All right guys so before we move on here I just want to be able to have custom titles for each page

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,230
and this is something I could have done early on but I wanted to get all of our templates all set before

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,020
I did that.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,970
OK and now I think we have every single template every page every HTL page is now incorporated into

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,200
our application.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,930
So I think that it's a good time to implement that and it's very easy.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,670
All we have to do is disclose all this stuff up.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,860
All we have to do is go into our base each team out and we just simply need to add another block and

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,720
we're going to put that up in the title.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,050
Now I do want and it's up to you how you want to do this but I do want to have Beati real estate in

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,270
every page title but then have the rest of the title after it.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,910
So like a subtitle.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,230
All right.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,600
And you can do this how you want.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,950
Usually you have like a pipe character or a hyphen or something like that.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,340
You could put the hyphen in the template like this.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,770
But then again if you if you forget or you don't have a custom title on a page it's just going to look

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,900
like this with nothing after it.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,310
Or you can choose to put the hyphen or the pipe character within the template OK and I'll show you what

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,700
I mean.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
So I'm just going to leave it.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm going to put the character inside the template just in case we don't have a title to a page but

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,140
we just want to add a block here.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:35,590
So we're going to say block and I'm going to call this title and we want to of course and the block.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:45,330
So it's a hand block save that and then let's go let's start off with our home page will go to pages

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,440
and then index each team out.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,330
And for the title here I mean you guys can you can do whatever you want.

28
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,090
I'm just going to put the word home or welcome.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,730
And where we want to put this is I'm going to put it right after we load the load humanize.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:15,850
So read here so we want to say block title and let's just do welcome.

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,400
And what I was talking about is we would put pipe like that

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,340
in then and block.

33
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,430
All right.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,180
So let's see that see if it works.

35
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,420
So go to the home page and reload and now we get Beati real estate with pite character and welcome.

36
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,160
So it's up to you where you want to put the character.

37
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,190
So let's add some other ones I'm just going to go ahead and copy this because as you can see now if

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,600
we went to about life we forgot to put a title over we didn't want to put a title it still just is BT

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,430
real estate.

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,770
If we did it the other way we would have just a pipe character which looks kind of silly.

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,760
So I mean I don't know it's up to you on how you want to do it.

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,070
So for a boat to go up here we're going to go right under load static.

43
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:19,180
I always want to put the title like right above the content and we'll just say about BT hiree or let's

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,500
say just you about us.

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,720
OK I'll save that.

46
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,520
Let's go to see what other pages we have here.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Let's go to listings and we'll go to listings for each team.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:45,840
And let's say Well say Brough's or browse property listings

49
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:06,530
K. let's go to search dot each team I'll go right here and we'll say search results

50
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,900
save that.

51
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,430
Now let's go to listing each team and this is really important because I actually want to put the title

52
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,370
of the listing in the in the page title.

53
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,100
So it's actually going to be dynamic.

54
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,450
I'm going to grab this right here listing title and put that in here.

55
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,130
That way it shows the title so let's save and we'll check that out in a minute.

56
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,520
But let's finish here so let's go to register accounts.

57
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,630
Slash register.

58
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,090
Whoops.

59
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,470
Me and I get a copy of that again.

60
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,930
Right.

61
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,160
So register

62
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,960
count go to log in accounts log in

63
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,010
log in account log in

64
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,700
and then we just have our dashboard

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,340
and let's just say dashboard

66
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,810
hopes

67
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,350
say user dashboard.

68
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,360
OK.

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,300
I think that's all of our templates.

70
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,560
I think that's all of our age html files.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,660
So let's go in and check them out.

72
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,720
Now on the front end web site.

73
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,230
So this is the about going to reload.

74
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:54,350
And we get about us feature listings we get browse properties register register account account log

75
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:05,810
in we go to see let's go to a single listing and notice that in the title now we can see 33 six circles

76
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,900
so we have the actual listing.

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,160
You could also put like the city and state whatever whatever you want it's absolutely fine whatever

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,680
you want to put.

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,230
If we log in and go to the dashboard

80
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,880
we get use or dashboard.

81
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,770
All right so all of our titles are good.

82
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,330
So now we're going to do in the next section is we're going to start to work with contacts OK or inquiries.

83
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,610
Basically we want to be able to submit this form right here.

84
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,000
OK so this should get submitted to a view method and it should.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,430
This stuff should get added to the database.

86
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,060
And we're also going to make it so that if you're logged in then your name in your e-mail is automatically

87
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,640
put in the form.

88
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,690
Also it should get put in the database your user ID should get put in the in the in the row as well.

89
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,020
All right.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:08,040
That way we can track logged in users inquiries and we can put that in their dashboards.

91
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,920
OK so we're going to get into that in the next section.
