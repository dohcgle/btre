1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,450
All right to the last video we completed the log in the authentication we were able to log in successfully

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,780
we were redirected to the dashboard but the dashboard is nothing more than an H-1 in the template.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,500
So we need to.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,070
We need to fix that.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's go back to.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,430
I'm going to go to my Sublime Text because that's where I actually have my bootstrap theme and I'm going

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,070
to go to dashboard aged Yamal.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,340
We want to go below all the nav bar stuff.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:35,220
So right here to the section and we're going to go all the way down to right above the footer.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,950
OK dashboards not that big of a page.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,470
And then let's go back to vs code and go to templates accounts dashboard aged hemol.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,920
OK we're going to want to paste to sin.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,860
But of course we need to extend our base template.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,590
So let's do

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:02,840
extends base died aged him now and we need to wrap this all in a Coke and a code block

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,050
so block content.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,330
I should say a content block code block use me we need to end that down here.

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,860
OK so let's save that.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,050
And if we now look at the dashboard we reload.

20
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,120
Now this is all just static data.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,850
Obviously we've done nothing to do with contacts yet or inquiries we haven't even created the application

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,450
yet.

23
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,750
So this is all static.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,400
But we do have the nav bar showing OK and that's what I want to focus on because I mean we're logged

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,770
in and we don't want register and log in to show we want this to be different.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,250
So let's go back to the dashboard and I just want to change one thing here before we get into that.

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,950
And that's the breadcrumb we don't want this to go to index aged him now.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,830
We want to put in our tags and we want you Arel and we want to go index.

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:14,430
OK so now what I want to do is head on over to our NAV bar partials so templates Parshall's underscore

30
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,690
now Barcott HD IMAO.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:27,920
And I want to go right inside of the UL right here with the nav bar nav and Eldo right above this ally

32
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:40,880
and I'm going to put a conditional I'm going to say if user Daut is underscore authenticated OK so basically

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,560
if the user is logged in and then we're going to do in else.

34
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,310
OK.

35
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,810
And I want everything that's here which is the the register in the log in Ally tags to be within the

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,690
rules.

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,810
OK so I'm just going to go down to the last.

38
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,640
This ending ally and just tab that over and then right underneath it I'm going to tab back and I'm going

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,180
to put the end if here.

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,320
And just to test this so let's just say whatever.

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,850
Hello.

42
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,400
Just to see if this works.

43
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,270
I want to save and let's go back and reload

44
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,650
and you can see how low and the reason you can't really see it until I highlighted it is just because

45
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,460
it's not a link and just it's just the way the CSSA is but we know that that conditional is working.

46
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,590
All right so now we want to do is construct a log log out to link.

47
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,790
We actually want to log outlaying and dashboard link.

48
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,340
But the trick here is the logo.

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,810
It can't just be like an 8 in a tag with an 8 traffic can't be a link it can't be just a standard get

50
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,930
request it has to be a post.

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,560
So what we'll do is we'll create a form that will be that will look like a link.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,800
OK hopefully that makes sense because the form is what we use to make a post request.

53
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,700
We could use javascript and make a you know use the fetch API or Ajax or something like that but I'm

54
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,880
just going to construct a simple form to log out.

55
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,110
But let's first put the dashboard to link so let's see how we want to do this let's grab

56
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,890
Let's actually grab one of these allies right here.

57
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,050
So this whole register ally.

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,130
And I'm going to paste that in here.

59
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,760
And let's see if

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,180
dashboard in request path we're going to have this stuff.

61
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,260
And then down here let's change this to dashboard

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,610
and the URL is going to go to dashboard

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,850
OK.

64
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,120
Let me just let's see we don't want an icon here right.

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:11,000
So we'll just get rid of this tag and I'm just going to save this and just see if this shows up correctly

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,080
and works so there we go dashboard good if click on that.

67
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,520
All right so now we have a way to get to our dashboard.

68
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,600
Now in addition to just dashboard I want to say like how welcome and then whatever the username.

69
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,310
So remember we have access to this user object within the within the template.

70
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,900
OK so within all templates.

71
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,690
So I'm actually going to say welcome.

72
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:46,280
I'll say welcome notes to our double curly braces and will say user and we can access any field of the

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:54,510
user and I'm going to access user name and then I'm just going to put dashboard in parentheses like

74
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:54,930
that.

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:03,310
So now if I say can we go back and reload says Welcome Caffey and dashboard just to let you know that

76
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,200
if you click on it it will take you to the dashboard and I spelt dashboard wrong.

77
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,450
If you don't want to have the dashboard there and just say welcome or you don't even want the welcome

78
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,130
that's fine whatever you want to do is that's your preference but let me just fix this.

79
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:25,190
I always I type like too fast when I write dashboard I always put the a before the show.

80
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,630
So hello we have that let's take care of the logo.

81
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,770
So right underneath.

82
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,310
Let's see I'm trying to figure out where where this is going to go.

83
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,760
We have our Atallah have ending ally.

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,970
So let's put another

85
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,830
yeah let's put it another ally

86
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,060
and let's give it class.

87
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:02,160
We don't need the active so we don't need to do the if statement so to say now have item and let's do

88
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,590
Marjan right.

89
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,720
Three OK so we're going to do that.

90
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:13,570
And then let's put in a tag with the class of NAV dash Lanc and you'll see what I'm doing in a minute

91
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,700
here.

92
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:22,650
I'm actually going to put in here javascript and then some curly braces and what this will allows us

93
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,060
to do is actually write some javascript in here.

94
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:36,750
So I'm going to say document get element by id and the ID is going to be logo.

95
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,930
And then I just want to call Daut submit.

96
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,820
OK that's all I want there.

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,260
Now let's wait a minute.

98
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,900
Yeah.

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,430
So we have the the Tref we have the class of NAV link.

100
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,570
So inside here inside the tag I'm going to put an icon like a log out icons so we're going to do F.A.

101
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:10,400
ass and let's do a dash sign dash out dash Alt.

102
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:19,620
That will give us a little logo link and then I'm going to say logo right next to it like that.

103
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,710
All right.

104
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,710
Now when we click this it's going to run this little piece of javascript.

105
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,730
It's going to look for the idea of log out and it's going to submit the form.

106
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,730
So we want to create that form.

107
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,260
So we're going to put that right on right underneath this a tag.

108
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,820
So we'll see a form with an ID of Logo at OK.

109
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:50,220
Now the action is going to go to the URL of Logo.

110
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,570
OK remember we have that route.

111
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:01,730
So the action will go to log out we want to make sure that we add a method of post here.

112
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,320
We have post request.

113
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,460
And let's see inside the form.

114
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,320
We're not going to do much we do want to put our CSR token just like we did with the other post form

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,330
so which one of you see as are half underscore token and then we're just going to put an input with

116
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,910
the type of hidden

117
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,220
OK just like that.

118
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,430
So all this is all this should do is make a post request to log out.

119
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,470
So let's save this and then let's go back to the used up high inside accounts and you can see we have

120
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,920
our logo here and we want to check to see if it's a post request just like we did up here with like

121
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:57,770
the log in in the Register saying to copy that line and let's put that here.

122
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,020
So we're going to say if there's a post request we want a logo.

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,860
So off dot log it's as simple as that.

124
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,200
We just want to pass in the request that should Laaga.

125
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,200
So we want to send the message a success message.

126
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:25,200
Pass the request and the message will just say you are now logged out and let's redirect to index just

127
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,250
want to Tab this over and over and that should do it.

128
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,760
If we did it right so let's save it and let's see if things work out.

129
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:42,250
So a reload and easy now we have a logo link if I click that message is not defined so it should be

130
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,390
messages but we still should have logged out because it should have ran this.

131
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,240
They happened here.

132
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,880
So if we go back we should be logged out.

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:11:00,240
When I reload OK so up here now notice it says register and log in again and we got that little message

134
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,810
here.

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,460
It was like stuck to the top.

136
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,770
So I think what I'm going to do

137
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,310
I mean there might be a better place to put that in the index.

138
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,810
That the Parshall's alerts.

139
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:23,100
I mean we could do like we could put some CSSA we could do a line break or something like that.

140
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,060
What if we did that.

141
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,020
I mean that pushes it down a little but I think that's right.

142
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
So let's try again let's log in.

143
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,850
So I'd say Cathy

144
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,520
K. so we're logged in and we went to the dashboard.

145
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,610
Now if you want a message to say like you're now logged in which I think if we look at views up high

146
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,180
we look at our log in.

147
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,920
Yeah you get that message.

148
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,090
But the dashboard doesn't have the alerts partially.

149
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,550
So we have to put that in there.

150
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:11,620
So it's called a dashboard and let's figure out where we want to put this.

151
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's put it right right below the breadcrumb

152
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,920
so alerts

153
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,360
clewed

154
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,390
Parshall's alerts on he urged him now.

155
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,820
All right so now when we log in it'll show right here welcome.

156
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,490
I mean it'll say you're now logged in.

157
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:39,760
OK.

158
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,030
And we can navigate around that log out.

159
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,760
And now success you're logged out and register and log in links are back in OK and the success matches

160
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,740
disappears after three seconds because of that piece of javascript that we put in.

161
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,030
All right.

162
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,070
So that's going to be it for this video guys.

163
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:04,420
Before we jump into contacts or inquiries in the next video I just want to do something that is very

164
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:11,050
simple but I think is necessary and that is to add to be able to change the titles up here for each

165
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:18,100
page because right now all the different pages OK whether it's a page or a listing they they all have

166
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,670
just beat real estate.

167
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,380
So I want to give you the option to change this.

168
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,310
And I think it's really important for listing pages.

169
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:31,450
I want to actually have the title of the listing in up here because if this comes up in a Google search

170
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,300
result then we want that in the title we don't want just BT real estate for everything.

171
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,650
All right.

172
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,530
So in the next video I'll show you how we can do that and then we'll move on to adding our contact model

173
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:52,600
or our contacts app with the model and database database table and we'll work on making inquiries or

174
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
making contacts.

175
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,430
When I say contacts and inquiries.

176
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,370
I mean the same thing I'm saying and I'm using them synonymously.

177
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,640
All right so that's it.

178
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,980
I will see you in the next video.
