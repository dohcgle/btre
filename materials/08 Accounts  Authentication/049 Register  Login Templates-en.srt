1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,760
All right guys so now that we have our accounts app created and we have but we're basically loading

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,600
up the correct views.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:15,930
So if we go to accounts and we go to our CEO used up pi which is right here we're loading up registries

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,360
to mail log and aged him out.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,220
So let's open up those those templates someone to open up log in age to e-mail and registry's to mail

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:31,200
and going to go back to my sublime bootstrap theme or bootstrap theme opened and sublime and I'm going

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,740
to go to Register.com each team now.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,800
We're going to go down past the nav bar to this section right here where it says Id register and we're

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,580
going to grab that section and that's basically it.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,580
OK we don't want the footer or anything like that and we're going to put that right in register.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,850
OK.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,990
Then we're going to grab.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,970
Let's go back and let's go to log in each team and do the same thing.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,940
We're going to grab section and that's.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,490
Take that and we'll put that right in the log in each time out.

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,250
OK.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,500
Now we have to extend the base layout so we're going to do that in both of these.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,130
OK.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,300
So let's do

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,240
extends based on age him now.

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,060
Let's see what else do we want to do we need to wrap this in the content block.

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,750
So I'd say block content and then at the end we need to end it.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,550
Whoops wrong symbol.

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,880
So we want to do and block.

25
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,470
All right so we're going to save that.

26
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm going to copy these two lines here and put that in register as well.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,930
OK.

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,460
And then at the end we want to end the block as well.

29
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,270
OK so now let's go back and reload and let's go to register.

30
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,060
OK so it shows the registering.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,120
Notice that it's highlighted that's from what we did in the last video.

32
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,590
Go to log in and we get our log in.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,120
All right.

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,770
Now let's see.

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,510
We have all of our fields and stuff like for the register you can see we have username make sure we

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,790
have our name attributes because that's what the server is going to read when we submit the form as

37
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,240
far as where this gets submitted to.

38
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,340
It's going to go to accounts slash register.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,170
OK so if we go to accounts used up PI it's going to submit to this log and we'll submit to this.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,920
OK.

41
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,600
Even though it's rendering the template that's for a get request if we post to it then we want we wanted

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,700
to actually do the registration and the logon.

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:03,220
So in register dot each team Mel let's go up to the form tag which is right here and change the action.

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,050
So for the action we want to put in our tags and we want to say you are Al and we want it to go to counts.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,460
Slash actually we should be able to just to register

46
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,830
it should be able to do that.

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,640
And we want to specify the method because by default it's going to do a get request.

48
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,330
We don't want that.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,870
We want it to do post.

50
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,370
OK so make sure you do that and is going to copy this and then go into log HCM I'll go to the form and

51
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,730
paste the sin and just change this to logon.

52
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,560
Now one thing that's very important when you're when you have a form and you're making a post request

53
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,880
you want it you want to add a what's called a CSIR token.

54
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:55,270
And this prevents cross-site forgery So basically it ties it ties your form to the user's session in

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,720
the current session so that no forgery can take place.

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,940
It's just it's a security precaution and it's very very easy to implement with Django.

57
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:13,190
All we have to do is simply go right in the form tag put in our template tags and we just do C-s R.F.

58
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,730
underscore tokened guy.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,090
So we want to do that.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm going to save this.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,290
I'm actually going to copy this and we want to do this in the register form as well.

62
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,700
So right under the form and we can actually take a look at this.

63
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:35,000
If we go to the to the front end and reload and I'm going to open up my console here and let's inspect

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,490
the element.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:36,930
OK.

66
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,840
So we want to go right here.

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,360
So see the form right under it we have this in this hidden input and this is the this is what we just

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,970
added.

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,460
Ok so you can see this is the token this long long string.

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,070
All right so that will prevent cross-site forgery.

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:04,460
So let's see if we have our forms in place they should submit to to our view methods much going to do

72
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,680
the actual logic.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:14,180
But let's go to our views dot PI and when they get submitted we need to identify if the request to register

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,200
and log in is a post or a get.

75
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,630
OK so let's let's just put an if statement in here.

76
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:29,280
And we're going to say a free Quest Daut method is equal to post.

77
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,150
Ok so if it's equal to post then we know that it's the form submission.

78
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:43,990
So for now I'll just I don't know let's just do like a print and I'll say

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:57,140
submitted or submitted wreckage and then we'll just do a redirect just to make sure it works.

80
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,780
And we'll just redirect to register.

81
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,300
Same page.

82
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,180
Okay.

83
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,510
And then I'm going to have an else.

84
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,590
So else then we just want to show the form.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,610
OK we want to render the form so let's save this.

86
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,310
And now where this will print out is in our console so if I go down to my console and my server is running

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,540
let's go here and let's reload and let's submit all we have to fill this stuff out.

88
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,920
Let's use your name and.

89
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,770
Test test Jeem now.

90
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,280
And doesn't matter.

91
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,620
We'll put some validation in later on.

92
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,880
But let's submit.

93
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,200
OK so we just it just redirected us.

94
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,680
But let's take a look at our terminal.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,590
I mean our terminal here and we get submitted wretch.

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,190
OK so we know that a post request was made.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,110
So that's all I want.

98
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,050
I want to do.

99
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm I'm going to do though the actual registration in the next video but I wanted to make sure that

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,950
that's being submitted.

101
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,600
OK.

102
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,730
So let's just actually get rid of this the stuff in here and this is where our logic will go so we'll

103
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,020
say register user.

104
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,730
OK and then we're going to do the same thing down below I'm just going to copy this whole block right

105
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,800
here and replace this and just make sure we change this back to log in.

106
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,660
OK.

107
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,980
And this will be logging user.

108
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,830
All right.

109
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,760
So we're going to get an error here because actually why.

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah because we don't have nothing in here.

111
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,040
I mean we could just put a return like that.

112
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,300
It's sort of that OK.

113
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,690
Just so we don't have an error.

114
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,560
But in the next video we're going to go ahead and add our logic to register the user.

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,440
We're going to do a little bit of validation.

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,010
We need to for instance I'm going to keep a lot of the validation on the client side.

117
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,990
So basically what I mean is we have required OK sort of required here.

118
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,800
We could do min length if you want.

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm not going to get too deep into validation on the client side.

120
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:27,320
Just some basic stuff like just the built in each team or five javascript stuff on the server side.

121
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,200
We need to make sure that these passwords match.

122
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,860
OK.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,430
Another thing we want to do is check the e-mail to make sure that there is not already an e-mail in

124
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,110
the system that matches that as well as the username.

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,810
OK so we need to check that.

126
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,580
And I think that's that'll do it.

127
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,500
So and then we'll just register the user which is actually very easy.

128
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,020
OK another thing we want to do is we want to have a message we want to basically like a bootstrap alert

129
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,840
message that says success you're now registered and you can log in.

130
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,100
You can make it so that when you register you log in automatically but I don't really like to do that.

131
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,870
I like to just let them register and then have them log in afterwards.

132
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,450
But it's up to you how you want to do that.

133
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,980
All right.

134
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,770
And I'll show you how to do both.

135
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,900
So I will see you in the next video.
