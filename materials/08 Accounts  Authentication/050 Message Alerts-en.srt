1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,190
All right guys so I apologize in the last video when I put in the form I didn't have the first name

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,740
and last name fields you guys should have that in your version of the template.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,360
I just forgot to update mine with them.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,690
But we do want them.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,710
So I wanted to do the registration.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,580
But before we do that I want to configure messaging.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,600
OK are messages alerts.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,390
Basically like if we get something wrong here like the password doesn't match I want to have a nice

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,870
bootstrap formatted message that tells us that.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,680
So there's a few things we need to do in order to make that work now now Gengel comes with a messages

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,390
app.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,190
OK.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:48,520
So in the installed apps there's actually Django doc contrabass messages and we need to just configure.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,140
We don't need to do this.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,000
What we do need to add is message tags right here into our settings file.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,220
All right so I'm actually going to copy this in and let's go to our settings file so we want to go to

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,670
be Tiare and then setting's up PI.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,530
I'm going to go down to the bottom down to the very bottom and let's say messages and I'll paste that

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,170
in.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,560
OK so basically we're saying from Gengel dot com trip Doug messages import Constans as messages.

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,370
OK.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,140
And then for message tags we're going to get rid of this.

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,180
I don't care about that.

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:40,250
What I do want to do is we have certain classes for bootstrap for different light colors like danger

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,890
is for red right.

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:50,390
So I'm going to actually change messages and change info to error and I'm going to set that to danger

27
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,970
like that.

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,290
OK and you'll see why.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,060
We're actually going to create a separate partial for messages or alerts I'm actually going to call

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,280
it alerts.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,830
But yeah there's a whole messaging system and you can see up here and installed apps that messages is

32
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,130
one of the default apps that are included with Django.

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,590
So just go ahead and add this to your settings and save it.

34
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,060
All right.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:24,940
Now once we do that we want to then create a partial.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,930
OK so inside templates Parshall's let's create a file and call it messages.

37
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:42,140
I'm going to call it underscore alert or alerts dot HMO and we just want we want to add the bootstrap

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,960
markup so that it looks nice but of course if you weren't using bootstrap or you were using a different

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,450
framework or custom styling you can style it however you want.

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,970
But basically we first want to just test to see if there's a message.

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,830
So we want to say if messages

42
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,220
can't because we don't want like we don't want the mark up or anything showing if there's no messages

43
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,790
it's doing and def and then we want to loop through the messages if there are any.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,230
So we'll say for message in messages

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,560
and for.

46
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,270
All right.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,160
So this is where I'm going to put some mark up.

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,120
So when I actually put a div with the idea of message and a class of container.

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,980
OK.

50
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,990
And then we want to put out our bootstrap markup.

51
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:52,460
So with bootstrap we have a class of alert and then we usually have a class of like alert dash danger

52
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,630
or something like that.

53
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,680
Now remember in the settings I said error equals errors danger.

54
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,070
I'm actually going to replace this this word danger with messages.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,520
Our message dog tags.

56
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,930
OK.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,950
And then I want to make this Divx dismissable.

58
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:25,620
So in this class I'm also going to say Alert dash dismissable meaning that I can just close it.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,190
OK so it'll have an X and then I also want to text dash center and then I'm just going to put a roll

60
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,540
attribute as well.

61
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,550
This is just standard bootstrap syntax for an alert.

62
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,820
And then inside this div if it's a dismissable alert we need a button.

63
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,680
So I'm going to say Button give it a class of close.

64
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,700
OK we also want to give it the type of button

65
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,930
right.

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,710
So class of close it also needs an attribute of data Dasch dismiss which is just straight bootstrap

67
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,790
and that's going to be alert.

68
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,970
So data dismiss alerts.

69
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,260
Let's see we also want to put the Xmarks who we're gonna use the entity of Ampere's stamp.

70
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,270
Let's do yeah ampersand times semi-colon now.

71
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,280
Give it a little x and x.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,020
That's right I think we need to wrap that in a span this is just like if you go to the bootstrap Web

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,030
site and you go to components and then alerts.

74
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,420
This is what you're going to see.

75
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Actually want to add the aria dash hidden attribute like that and it should be true.

76
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,430
All right so that's the dismiss button underneath that I'm going to put in some strong tags and inside

77
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,020
here I'm going to check to see if if the message is in error.

78
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,510
So we can say if

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:28,250
message DOT level comes level is equal to default underscore message underscore levels dot error OK

80
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,190
and then we want to do an else

81
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,740
and let's do our.

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,490
And if

83
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,160
so if that's true then I just want to put the word error

84
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,150
right.

85
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,390
If not let's see soon that.

86
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:05,360
We want to put in our double curly braces and we want to see a message dot tags and then put a pipe

87
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,800
character and title.

88
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,260
OK.

89
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,730
And then right under that.

90
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:21,300
And if I'm sorry under that strong we want to put the actual message which is going to be a message.

91
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,210
OK.

92
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,480
So this snippet here you can use this in all of your ad if you're using bootstrap in all of your bootstrap

93
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,170
Django applications you can use this partial and use it as your error output or you or your message

94
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,550
outputs will save this and to test it.

95
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,590
Let's actually just tested by outputting it when we when we when we make the poster request when we

96
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,920
submit the form.

97
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:59,590
OK so to do that I'm going to let's do a redirect.

98
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,310
See you return redirect

99
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:15,480
to and say Index OK and then we have to we have to help with the partial wherever we want errors to

100
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,820
be to be able to go.

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,430
Let's actually redirect to register K to the same page.

102
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,540
Right above it if we want to output a message we do message Daut error if we want it to be an error

103
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:41,110
or pass in their request and then whatever the error is let's just say testing error message.

104
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,650
All right now to be able to use messages we need to bring an end so up here we're going to say from

105
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,630
Django dot contrib we want to import

106
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,670
messages.

107
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,430
All right.

108
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,280
So let's see.

109
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,550
Undefined variable message.

110
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:13,010
It's because it should be messages on error right now.

111
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,940
This is this is it's not going to show up because our partial isn't inserted into the register template.

112
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,650
OK so that's why we're redirecting to.

113
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:33,470
So what you want to do is open up the register HVM owl which is accounts register each team now.

114
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,430
And I need to figure out where to put this.

115
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:46,810
So I'm going to actually put it right below the card body so we can say alerts so any alerts that are

116
00:09:46,850 --> 00:10:02,080
output we want to include and we want to include Parshall's slash underscore alerts H.T..

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,640
All right so let's save that.

118
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,900
Let's also put it in the log in.

119
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,010
So I'm going to just copy this go to the log in each team mail and go right below the card body same

120
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,520
place and put that in there as well.

121
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,880
All right.

122
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,980
Now let's test it out.

123
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,180
So if we submit this form we should see that test error no matter what.

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
So let's just put whatever

125
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,520
there we go.

126
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,540
Error testing error testing error message.

127
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,920
OK.

128
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,220
Let's actually put a colon right here.

129
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,720
So basically that if statement was just going to put this out if it's an error and we can dismiss this

130
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,750
as well.

131
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,980
So let's go back in and go back to our partial.

132
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,870
And I'm just going to put a coat on right here and it's up to you if you don't want to put the word

133
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,190
error.

134
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,310
That's fine.

135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,200
That's that's all US is doing.

136
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,850
Yes.

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,030
We'll go ahead and save that.

138
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,980
Now one more thing I want to show you is if you want the error to disappear on its own we could add

139
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:14,900
a little bit a custom javascript so if we go to our beat every folder and go to static J.S. main dot

140
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,750
ass and put some words just use a little bit of J.A.G. to do a fade out.

141
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:27,670
So I'm going to say set time which isn't Jay Corey it's just a javascript function to just kind of hold

142
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,150
off on doing something or hold off and then do something.

143
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,610
So it takes in a function Guice will say function.

144
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:49,000
And what we want to happen is we want to use J.A.G. to grab the element with the idea of message and

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,450
we want to just do a fade out.

146
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,660
So Dot fade out and we'll just put in this takes in the speed or just too slow.

147
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,230
And then the second parameter for set time is the time so we'll say 3000.

148
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,730
So basically after three seconds of the message showing it should fade out.

149
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,440
All right.

150
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,500
Now since we put this in a static folder in Beati sorry we need to run create static so that it goes

151
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,090
into the main static folder.

152
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:24,550
So down here in the terminal Let's go ahead and do Python managed it.

153
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,000
PI create static.

154
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm sorry collect static create static

155
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,670
collect static overwrite let's say.

156
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,190
Yes.

157
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,480
OK.

158
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:52,550
So let's go ahead and try it now I'm going to reload this and just put a bunch of junk in here.

159
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,710
Register.

160
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,790
OK we're going to wait three seconds.

161
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,070
And nothing.

162
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,430
All right.

163
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,490
Let's check out the console there's nothing there.

164
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's see.

165
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,400
Let's look at mean chess

166
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,460
it's not there you know what I think we might have to restart the server.

167
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:34,020
So what I'm going to do is go to my other terminal here and just restart.

168
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,300
All right.

169
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,880
So let's try that again.

170
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,100
OK let's run it

171
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,760
now.

172
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,000
Still didn't work.

173
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:08,110
What the heck is it not there when we run collect static what it's supposed to do is put it in here.

174
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,850
So if we look in Manges here it is there it could be cash cashed

175
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,960
let me just clear.

176
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,910
I'm going to clear the cash with command shift.

177
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,380
Or you could do shift F5 on Windows.

178
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,550
Let's try that.

179
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,150
So hopefully this works.

180
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,380
There we go.

181
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,790
All right.

182
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,930
So it was cash that's why that didn't work.

183
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,870
So if you want to do that you can if not just remove that line of Javascript.

184
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,810
But I like it to go away on its own.

185
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,990
So now that we have the messaging figured out and I know that that was kind of like a sidebar.

186
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,270
Now we can continue to do the register because now when we get when the passwords don't match for instance

187
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:14,420
all we have to do is we can close up close up all we have to do is inside our view is just call message

188
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,040
dot error and redirect to register and it will show the error.

189
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,360
So in the next video we're going to cover the whole user registration.

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,490
All right so I'll see you then.
