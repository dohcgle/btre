1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,680
All right in the last video we took care of the registrations so we were able to go to register fill

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,660
out the form we have some validation going on.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,310
And once we pass it it registers the user as you can see we registered a user called Kathy.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,500
Now we want to be able to log in with that account.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,720
So let's go to vs code and inside our views up PI that's in the accounts folder we're going to go down

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,140
to the log and method.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,050
OK so that's the method that we want to use here.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,250
So we are already checking to make sure that it's a post request meaning the form is submitted.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,130
We're going to get rid of this return here and replace it.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,470
And we want to get the variables just like we did above except there's only two that we want and that's

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,940
the user name and password that comes in from the form so let's say request dot post and we want the

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,600
user name.

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,470
OK we also want the password

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,580
OK.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,190
So we have those two now to be able to log in or authenticate.

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:14,040
We want to create a variable called user I'm going to set it to off which I already brought in in the

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,790
last video could be coming from Django Contra.

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,050
And then there's an authenticate method case we want to see authenticate.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,230
We want to do username equals the username variable it's above which is whatever is submitted in the

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,380
form and then password which is equal to the password that's submitted in the form.

21
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:40,590
OK then we want to I just do want to be in here.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,580
We want to check to see if user is not None.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,430
OK.

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,550
So if user is not None.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:58,610
That means that we want to off does that means that the users found OK so that means it's found in the

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,300
database by this username and password.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,460
So these are matched in the database.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,510
Then we want to log in.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:15,260
So we say Auth. dot log in and this takes in the requests and it also takes in the user OK.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,860
So that's that's pretty much it to log in.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:26,050
So we're going to do a message a success message so let's say message dot success and we'll say request

32
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:36,980
request and we'll say you are now logged in and then we'll redirect.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,540
So it's do a return redirect.

34
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,070
Now we're going to redirect to the dashboard and I know that we haven't I don't think we created that

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,270
template yet or we'd like or we didn't.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,830
It's just like an H1 but that's ultimately what we're going to want to do.

37
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,040
So I'm just going to put that will probably work on that next.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,980
But we want to do an else here.

39
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,100
So if the user is not found then what do we want.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,960
Do we want to output an error.

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,150
So will say messages this actually should be messages not just message so messages dot our past in our

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,790
request and then the error that we want to give is invalid credentials.

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,170
OK.

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,430
And then we're going to redirect.

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,790
So we want to return redirect and let's redirect to log in.

46
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,690
All right so we'll save that and sorry load

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,320
just refresh and then I'll just put in whatever say Invalid credentials.

48
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,830
Good.

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,910
So let's try to log in as Cathy.

50
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,770
So if I say Cathy put in or correct password and log in we get redirected to the dashboard.

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,430
And this is the front and this is the front end dashboard This has nothing to do with the admin.

52
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,460
Now if I go back to my admin and I reload we're going to be logged out because remember these are these

53
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,050
users are all on the same table.

54
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:14,270
So if you're logged in as Kathy then we're logged in as Cathy there's no being logged in as Brad in

55
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,610
the in the admin area.

56
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,000
And Cathy doesn't have access to the admin area so we're gonna be booted out.

57
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,590
So just know that that's how our our workflow is going to kind of go from now on.

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,140
But yeah so we're logged in now.

59
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,190
So we need a way to log out.

60
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,590
We also need to create the dashboard.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,630
OK we don't even have a nav bar to add a out.

62
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,760
So I think in the next video what we'll do is is add the markup for the dashboard and then we can work

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,410
on the go right so we'll see in the next video.
