1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,870
All right guys so in this video we're going to start to work on our registration.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,150
We need to do a little bit of validation for our form and then we're going to register a user.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,240
Right now we're checking to see if it's a POST request if it is in the last video we just tested out

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,990
the messaging.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,510
So I'm going to get rid of these two lines and we're going to want to put everything into variables.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:28,580
OK so every every form field that's submitted we want to put into variables so let's say get form values.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,050
So we're going to create a first name and the way that we get these values is by using request.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,520
But instead of using get like we did with the the you are l queries and the GET requests we want to

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,850
use post since it's a post for and then we just want to put whatever the input name is in this case

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,910
this first name and we want six of these so two three four five six.

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,600
And we're going to change this one to last name

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,960
K then we're going to do a user name

13
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,490
then we're going to do email

14
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,990
OK we also want password

15
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,980
password and we want the password to

16
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,340
OK.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:43,290
So now that we have those we want to start to do some validation lets say check if passwords match.

18
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,070
So we simply say if wups.

19
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,750
No no parentheses.

20
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,500
Password is equal to password 2.

21
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,820
Then we want to actually let's do our else first so else.

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,410
So if there is no or if the passwords don't match then what do we want to do we want to show an error

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,760
or I just like just like I did before.

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,470
So we're going to say message is you know WANT THAT THERE.

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:24,390
When do message or messages I'm sorry dot error takes in request and then takes in whatever we want

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,410
to output as a message which is going to be passwords do not match.

27
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,900
OK.

28
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,190
And then after that we're going to redirect.

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:44,810
So we want to return redirect and we're going to redirect to the same page or just register.

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,220
OK.

31
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,800
So let's actually just try that so far make sure that the validation works.

32
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,190
Let's just put a return in here for now just to shut the error up.

33
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,030
OK so we'll go back to our registry and reload and doesn't matter what we put in here.

34
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,160
This can be anything.

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,180
Password.

36
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,040
Now I'm going to make this not match so I'll do like 1 1 1 2 2 to register.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,970
There we go passwords do not match.

38
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,500
And after three seconds that disappears that's exactly what I want to happen.

39
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:21,830
All right.

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,720
So let's go back now.

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,090
They do match.

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,550
We want to move on but we have some more validation to do we don't want to have duplicate user names

43
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,850
or duplicate emails so that's those are some things we're going to have to add here.

44
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:45,960
So let's say check user name and to do that we need to actually bring in the user model.

45
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,650
OK so we didn't create the user model but it comes default with Django.

46
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,880
But we still need to bring it in to use it.

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:05,600
So a peer will say from outside it's going to be from Django dot contrib dot off dot models and then

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:13,760
we want to import uppercase U user and then we can use that model just like we could use any model just

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,760
like we did with the listing in the realtor and so on.

50
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,150
So for the check username we're going to do it if we're going to say user dot objects remember objects

51
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,800
fetches from the database.

52
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:33,440
We want to put a filter case we want to do filter and we want to filter by user name equals username.

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,500
OK we're checking the user name field in the database for this value which is this this variable up

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,760
here and then we simply want to tack on Dot exists.

55
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,360
Ok so it's just a helpful method that will let us know if that user name exists.

56
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,360
So we'll put a colon colon here and if that's true then we want to show an error because that means

57
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,950
there is already a user with that username right.

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:08,690
So we don't we don't want them to be able to register so we're going to send an error say request and

59
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,700
the error will say that user name is taken.

60
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:23,120
And then again we're going to return a redirect to the register.

61
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,060
So this needs an else.

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,830
So if there is no user name that means we want to continue but we want to check for that e-mail because

63
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,000
we want that to be unique.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,310
So it's going to be virtually the same thing.

65
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,150
So I'm going to just copy this right here this whole if else and we want to make sure we're and we're

66
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:48,540
indented here inside this else piece that in case this should be like that.

67
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,570
And we're just going to say if user data object start filter by e-mail.

68
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,030
So e-mail equals e-mail exists.

69
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:08,590
Then we're going to say that e-mail that e-mail is is being used and we're going to redirect.

70
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,500
OK else then we'll just say looks good.

71
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,630
OK so everything is passed.

72
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,530
So I'm going to say this I just want to test those things.

73
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:26,240
Now as far as users we have one user in the database I believe it's what's what's the user name.

74
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,800
Brad I believe I mean we can check when we can check in the back end here for go back home.

75
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,020
Will I not have my server running.

76
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,240
Oops.

77
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,480
You just check something real quick it's probably because there's nothing here so let me just do.

78
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,490
Let me just put a return here and save and make sure my server is still running.

79
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,950
It's in the other terminal.

80
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,780
OK good that fixed it.

81
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:53,910
All right.

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,060
So I will go back and reload.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,950
OK so users.

84
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,880
And you can see we have a username of Brad in an e-mail address of Brad at gmail so I should not be

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,140
able to register with either of those.

86
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,740
All right so let's try that.

87
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,810
Let's start with.

88
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,220
It doesn't matter what we put in here or here.

89
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,600
I just want to try that Brad user name.

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,290
OK.

91
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,950
E-mail.

92
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,580
I'm not going to it doesn't matter.

93
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,730
Password.

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,890
Now this has to match.

95
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,940
We'll get an error so let's do just one one one one on one.

96
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,170
It's register.

97
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,730
There you go.

98
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,390
That user name is taken.

99
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,500
Perfect.

100
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,240
So let's try the e-mail now.

101
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:42,100
So remember that e-mail is Bradd at gmail dot com.

102
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:48,880
I'm sorry that you go in here username we'll just say whatever password

103
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,290
that e-mail is being used.

104
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,930
All right so all the validation is working now we want to continue to actually register the user.

105
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,040
So to do that and get rid of this return let's create a variable called the user.

106
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,860
And we're going to send it to a user Daut objects and there's a method called create user guys who want

107
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,690
to do that and we want to pass in all the fields so a user name equals user name we want to do password

108
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:39,110
equals password email equals email first name he called his first name last name.

109
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,910
He calls last name is that it.

110
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,480
I think that's it.

111
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,310
Username password email.

112
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,030
Yeah that should be it.

113
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,800
So I I just want to show you two ways of doing it.

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,510
Now if you want to log the user and once they're registered will say law you log in after register what

115
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:09,110
you could do is you could say off Daut log in and you could pass in the request and the user that we

116
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,260
just created here.

117
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,700
Now if you want to use this off object right here you actually have to bring it in and it's part of

118
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,140
Gengel called Treb.

119
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,510
So we can just add it right here and that should work but I'm not I'm actually not going to do that.

120
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,920
If you do do that what I would do is put a message underneath.

121
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,040
So I'd say messages dot success OK because you don't want to be in error.

122
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,540
We want it to be a success message and say request

123
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,800
and we'll say you are now logged in.

124
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,660
OK.

125
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,850
And then just return redirect

126
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,110
to slash or index you could do index.

127
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,700
OK so that would do that.

128
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,140
I'm not.

129
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,440
I'm not going to do that but I'm going to comment it out just in case you guys want what I want to do

130
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,440
is register the user and then give them a message and redirect them to the logon page so that they can

131
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,210
manually log in after they register.

132
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,870
So to do that we take the user and we just call save.

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,390
OK so we say use your dot save let's do a success.

134
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:31,720
I'll just grab this and let's say you are now logged in or you are now registered

135
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,960
and can log in.

136
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,610
Whoops I put a semi-colon.

137
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,370
I mean like javascript mode today.

138
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:52,010
And then we're going to return a redirect and we do want to redirect to the logon page.

139
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,100
OK so hopefully hopefully this works.

140
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,130
Let's try it out.

141
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,510
So I'm going to reload the register page and I'm actually going to try and register so let's say it

142
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:19,550
was say Kathy last name Smith username which is to Cathy g mail and let's match these passwords.

143
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,480
It's going to do one through six and register.

144
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,290
OK success you are registered and can log in.

145
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,320
Awesome.

146
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:37,750
So if we go to our admin area into the user section if I reload there was Kathy OK and if you look at

147
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:45,190
Staff Status there's an app excuse me there's an X mark because she's just a regular front end user.

148
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,660
OK.

149
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,360
And notice the password is hashed automatically so you don't have to worry about any of that.

150
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
You don't have to worry about hashing your passwords It just happens automatically.

151
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,970
So awesome we can now register for we can now register on the front end.

152
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,980
So what I want to do next is handle the log in.

153
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,950
But before I do that I just want to add in a couple of play.

154
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,570
Actually I think only the home page.

155
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:20,460
I want to add the ability to have messages or alerts because you know how I put if you wanted to log

156
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,610
in after you register it puts out a message and then redirects you to the index.

157
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,260
But the index page doesn't have the alerts.

158
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,750
I don't believe the alerts partial included.

159
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:39,150
So let's go down to templates and then go to see where we go and pages indexed on each team.

160
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,380
And we want to put the alerts somewhere in here.

161
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,930
So let's see I think

162
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,980
a good place to put this.

163
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,490
Let's go under the whole Showcase area.

164
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:06,530
And I actually don't know where to put this.

165
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,670
I mean I guess

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,810
let's just take a look at the front end here.

167
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:22,930
We could put it right above the latest listings like right here know let's do that sort of latest listings

168
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:32,420
I believe the alerts if we look at the partial history here we have Dave idea message it has a class

169
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,490
of containers so it will be it'll be put in the middle so that should be fine.

170
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,780
So for that

171
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,700
I'll put it right here.

172
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,860
So let's do our include

173
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,660
Parshall's slash underscore alerts studies.

174
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,680
OK so just in case you redirect to the home page and you want to and you want to show a message you

175
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,290
want to show an alert.

176
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,720
All right guys.

177
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,090
In the next video we're going to make it so that we can take the use of that we just created and we

178
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,160
can log in with that user.

179
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,200
OK so we're going to do authentication then we're going to work on the nav bar because obviously this

180
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,630
should be different if we're logged in.

181
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,240
We should also have a way to log out.

182
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,130
So we need to work on all that stuff.

183
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,710
So I will see you in the next video.
