1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,290
All right guys so now we're going to do is start to get into accounts.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,840
We want users on the front end to be able to register to be able to log in and we're going to have a

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
little simple dashboard.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,660
We want this functionality not so much just for that so they can see their inquiries.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,930
But just to have the functionality in case you want to add something else later where it's you know

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,760
you have to log in to do something.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,710
So most applications that you're going to build are going to have front front web site facing user accounts.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,330
OK so I did want to throw that in to this course.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,330
I didn't want to just make it you know only the admins had logging privileges because I think that it

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,380
wouldn't give you a full view of Django.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:45,980
All right.

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,630
And I know that I I mean I can't cover everything in this project or in this course but I'm trying to

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,230
cover all the all the core fundamentals things that you're going to be doing a lot.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,740
And obviously authentication is one of those things.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
So I think that the first thing we need to do here is create a separate app.

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,650
OK.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,030
And what I mean by app is like the listings realtor's pages these are all apps within Django.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,250
So we're going to create an account app.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,890
Ok so let's let's go to our terminal down here.

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,070
I have my server running in the other one so that's still running there.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,420
And what's that actually what's the error right there.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,360
Oh that's just for the Jay query loading.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,040
If I don't have.

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,060
That's fine.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,660
So we're going to go ahead and create a new app and if you guys remember we do that by doing Python

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:44,150
and we haven't done anything in the terminal for a while so manage dot pie and we're going to do start

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,420
app whenever we want to create a new application start app.

28
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,080
And this is going to be called accounts.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,020
OK.

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,600
So let's go and run that.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,830
And now over on the side you see we have accounts and we have all the default files here.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,940
Now Gengel already has a user system in place so we don't have to create an account or use or model.

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,530
We don't have to do any of that stuff.

34
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,340
We're just going to use the the the the user table that is already in place.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,600
So if we go to PGE admin and I guess I'll just leave this open here and you can see that there is a

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,960
off user table and it's probably not going to let me see.

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm going to have to reload and probably am probably gonna have to rely again because it's been quite

38
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,870
awhile now.

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,870
OK so I'm going to navigate.

40
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,050
I do have to log in if you let it go so long without touching it.

41
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,350
You'll have to log in again.

42
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:57,190
So we want to go to our database and let's just check out tables and we want to look at Auth. user extend

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,080
that if we look at the columns you can see all the different columns so user name first name last name

44
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:10,080
email is staff is what is going to allow them to log in to the back end or not.

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,830
There's no super user or they have the last log in the date joined if the users active.

46
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,120
All that stuff.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:25,970
And if we were to look at the data using Where is it to view data all rows we just have our one user

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,110
who is the admin.

49
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,260
OK so it's a super user and staff you can see as true.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,130
So obviously when a user creates an account in the front and we don't want them to be staff we don't

51
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,050
want them to be able to log into the back end.

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:48,200
All right so I think the first step here is to actually have a route or a couple routes for a register

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,850
and log in.

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,000
We can at least load those templates case we're going have to create those templates.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:01,010
So let's go to templates and going to close all these are or minimize these and in templates we're going

56
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:08,810
to have a folder called accounts and inside accounts we're going to have a couple of files log in each

57
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,370
team.

58
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,070
All we're going to do register HMO.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,600
And then we're going to have a dashboard that's also part of accounts so it's create dashboard Daut

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,670
aged him.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,300
All right.

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,010
So at least we have our templates.

63
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,320
Let's just put an H1 in here for now.

64
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,400
So this is Dash K H-1 this is

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,470
register and log in.

66
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,500
OK so we have our templates now let's go ahead and set up our routes.

67
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,470
So remember when we create a new app it doesn't automatically come with the DOT PI file and that's what

68
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,890
we need.

69
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,020
So we're going to create that in here.

70
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,250
So you are Elle's dot pi.

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,040
And before I do this before I forget we need to go to our settings so it's going to be in the Tiare

72
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,360
and then setting up high.

73
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,220
And we just want to add our app.

74
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,970
So I'm going to go below the realtor's app.

75
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,540
I'm just going to copy this down and this is going to be accounts config

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,780
and this is going to be accounts.

77
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,150
And that's something I always forget to do when I create a new app.

78
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:34,590
All right so you are also pie Let's actually copy from one of the other ones so we'll grab the listings.

79
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:42,320
You are up using Yarl's not pie and paste that in here.

80
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,320
So we're going to need four different you are Elle's.

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,580
OK so first one is going to be log in it's going to go to views Daut log and that will be the the method

82
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,580
name or the function name and the name will be log in.

83
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,310
Next is going to be register.

84
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:07,160
OK that's going to go to register name will be register.

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,830
All right.

86
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:20,510
And then let's see we also want to log out so log out that will call method Lago go in and then let's

87
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,910
copy this down one more this is going to be for the dashboard

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
spell right.

89
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,230
OK so Method views on dashboard

90
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,500
path dashboard.

91
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,170
All right now we're going to get these these errors here because we don't have the methods inside the

92
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,010
view.

93
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,230
So let's open up in the accounts folder we want the views.

94
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,730
Hi guys what's going on like this by default.

95
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,470
And we want to add all of our methods or should say views or their view methods.

96
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,550
So let's do register when I say define register.

97
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,340
And this takes in a request OK.

98
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,150
So this for this what I want to do is render a template.

99
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,620
So when you do render her return render.

100
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,750
And we want to pass in here.

101
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,810
First of all the request second is going to be the template which is going to be in the accounts folder

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,270
and then register for each team.

103
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,220
OK so that's that.

104
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:41,850
Let's actually just copy this because we need three more functions here or views.

105
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,280
You methods.

106
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,770
This one's going to be log in.

107
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,120
This will change that to log in will change the template that I want to load to log in.

108
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,040
So this is going to be log in each time now.

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,070
This next one is going to be the log out now log out isn't going to render a template.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,610
It's just it's going to you're going to put some functionality here to log the user out.

111
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,510
But ultimately at the end what I want it to do is redirect.

112
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,580
So I'm going to say return

113
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:22,340
redirect and that's put in here.

114
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,190
So we want to redirect to index.

115
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,020
All right now to use redirect we have to bring it in and it comes in just like render does from the

116
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,490
jingle shortcuts.

117
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,990
So we just want to make sure we bring that in.

118
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,760
All right.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,820
Whoops So last one here is going to be the dashboard method

120
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,200
and that's just going to simply render the dashboard.

121
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,780
And there we go.

122
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,110
Save.

123
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,010
OK let's go to PI and we just want to resave this and now we have no errors.

124
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,710
Good.

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,880
So let's try the trial the Rutz.

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,970
So if we go and reload these are still going to register dot HVM will log in each and.

127
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,550
So those aren't going to work yet we're going to fix that but let's go let's manually go to accounts

128
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,390
slash register.

129
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,210
OK so we're getting page not found Let's try logon

130
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,640
and start working either let's say using the oh we didn't bring in we didn't bring it into the main.

131
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,780
You are Alza up high.

132
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,930
So we need to go to BT houri you are up high.

133
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,890
We need to add here just like we did with the listings in the pages.

134
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,230
So we're going to see accounts slash.

135
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:51,770
So anything that is accounts slash we're going to include the accounts you are Elle's like that.

136
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,510
Okay.

137
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,560
So now that should work let's reload.

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,040
There we go.

139
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,560
So now we have accounts log in register.

140
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,830
Okay.

141
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,330
So now let's actually let's let's make the navigation go to the correct places.

142
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,570
So we want these links.

143
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,030
So those are in the nav bar partial.

144
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:21,410
So in the templates we want to go into Parshall's and underscore now barged him all down to register.

145
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,730
Okay so obviously we don't want this we want you are el

146
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,060
register and for log in

147
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,380
let's do this or no log in.

148
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,390
OK so let's try that out.

149
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,250
So it's load and click register that works good log in.

150
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,500
That works.

151
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,770
Now once we're actually logged in we were going to change is we don't want to see the register and log

152
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,090
in it for a log then that doesn't make any sense.

153
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,360
So what we're going to do is have conditionals that it's going to display a link to the dashboard will

154
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,280
actually have it say welcome and then our username have a link to the dashboard and also have a link

155
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,230
to logo.

156
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,270
OK but we'll do that later.

157
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,060
Before I end the video what I want to do is just go back to the template and just have the functionality

158
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,660
where the links are highlighted if were on those pages.

159
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,720
Obviously we're not going to see that yet because we don't have the layout but we'll just add the ifs

160
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,350
just like we did up here.

161
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:41,120
So I'm just going to copy this like we did for the listing and we want to go to the ally that's wrapping

162
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,970
the register link here and just basically just get rid of this class.

163
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,270
And right after the high here I'm going to just enter to go on the next line and then here's where we're

164
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,580
going to put the conditional cad's which sees over and all we want to do is change this to register

165
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,230
so if register in request path then it'll have the active class.

166
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,450
All right we'll do the same thing down here for log in.

167
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:19,200
So we'll get rid of this and go here paste that in its policies over and this is going to be if log

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,350
in OK we can't test it yet because you know on the template we don't have the layout but we'll do that

169
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,640
in the next video.

170
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,750
All right so I'll see you then.
