1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,780
All right guys in this video we're going to do two things we're going to set up our text editor which

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,510
is vs code and we're going to set up the python sandbox which is basically just a set of files that

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,850
we're going to use in the next section when we look at Python fundamentals.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,790
OK.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,830
Now the next section if you're already if you're already comfortable with Python and things like functions

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,500
and conditionals in dictionaries and different data types and structures and stuff like that then you

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,860
can completely skip that section and move on to Django.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,270
But if you're not that comfortable with Python or if you've never used Python I would definitely recommend

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,170
watching the whole next section in using the sandbox.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,430
OK now as far as your text editor Of course you don't have to use VS code if you want to use atom or

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,520
Sublime Text or an idea like pi chalmer eclipse or something like that.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,990
That's absolutely fine.

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,940
But we'll be using Visual Studio code so we're just going to do some some basic setup here.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,530
So if you want to download it you can go to cocotte Visual Studio dot com it's cross-platform Mac Windows

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,180
Linux.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,280
I already have it installed so I'm not going to go through the install process.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
It's very very self-explanatory.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,410
So let's jump into VS code.

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,620
So if you just downloaded it and install it you'll see a welcome screen you can just go ahead and close

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,260
that up.

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,490
And with this code you have a whole host of extensions you can install if you click on this icon here.

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,660
You can see these are the extensions that I have on this machine.

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,420
We actually want to install the python extension.

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,440
So if you search for Python it's going to be the first one you can see.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,530
There's almost 15 million downloads.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,390
So we're going to go ahead and install that.

27
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,210
OK once it installs you just click reload and now it's installed and that will give us things like lending

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,030
Intellisense and highlighting all types of stuff if you want to read more about it you can just click

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,020
on here and you can go through all of this stuff if you want.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,350
All right.

31
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,800
So now what I want to do is open up the sandbox files in vs code and if you're using a different text

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,760
editor just go ahead and open the files up in whatever you're using.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,900
So on my desktop I have the python sandbox Stoddard's zip file which you should have in this lecture.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm going to go ahead and extract that.

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,210
And this is what I want to open up but I'm just going to rename it to Python sandbox rather than just

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,670
you know Python sandbox starter.

37
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,220
And if I go to this code I'm just going to go to open file or open folder.

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm going to go to my where it's my desktop which I'm on and Python sandbox.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,830
OK so in here you see all the different files we just want to click open and we should get all of those

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,420
on the side here.

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,600
OK so I'm just going to open up one of these files variable's dot pi is the first one we're actually

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,910
going to be working with.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,000
These are just comments.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,770
Nothing is going to come of this.

45
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,270
We'll be adding on to this later but I just wanted to open up a python file.

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,930
Now if you type something in here and then just delete it and save control or command as you may get

47
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,050
a pop up that asks about Python lending.

48
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,570
It's up to you if you want to use that Linter or not.

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,510
We're going to use Lanting later on when we get into Django but I'm not going to use it for the the

50
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,390
for the next section so you can disable it if you want.

51
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,720
Or whatever.

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,830
So to run these files there's there's a few ways we can do it in vs code.

53
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,510
We're going to take the symbols out and just run Python 3.

54
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,130
And then whatever the file is like variables dot PI and that will run it.

55
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,910
We don't have any output here because there's nothing to output to output.

56
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,740
If I said like print 1 here and then we ran it we'd get one.

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,380
OK.

58
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,140
Now it's important to run it with Python 3 and it depends on how your system set up if you're using

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,360
Windows and you install Python.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,180
Chances are if you just do Python that's version 3 and you can easily check by doing a dash dash version.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,130
You can see on my system it's too.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,360
But if I do Python 3 dash dash version that's version 3.

63
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,120
OK and when we start to use virtual environments and stuff we work on that will no longer have to use

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Python 3 we'll just be able to use Python but we'll get into that later.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,560
So that's how we're going to run our files for now.

66
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,610
Another thing you could do is go to your debugger in vs code which is this right here.

67
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,960
And if you want to set this up you want to do a command shift p.

68
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,670
In fact you should do this anyway.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,130
And then just search for Python and go to a select interpreter.

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,490
OK.

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,700
Now later on when we work in virtual environments our virtual environment will actually show up here

72
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,290
and that's what we'll have to choose.

73
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,950
But for now we just want to make sure we choose 3.7 or three point whatever whatever version you're

74
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,820
using as long as it's Python Python 3.

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,660
All right then down here you can see that it actually now says Python 3.7.

76
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,470
So I could run this file and put the print back here so I could run this file now by simply clicking

77
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,490
the play button.

78
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,980
And choosing Python and now you can see that it ran.

79
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,830
It's going to give us like the whole path and all that stuff.

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,950
But you can see it ran because it printed out one if I want to change is to say print a string hello

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,010
world and we'll get into strings and all that stuff later.

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,900
But if I go ahead and press play and it runs so if you want to do it that way you can but I think just

83
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,280
putting in the file name is is an easier way to do it.

84
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,450
So it's up to you guys how you want to do it and of course if you're using a different terminal I'm

85
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,950
sorry a different text editor.

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,720
You know you can do it however you want.

87
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm sure there's different ways to run a file.

88
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,570
All right so now we're set up in the next section we're going to start off talking about variables and

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:56,320
data types how variables are constructed things like that and we'll go through pretty much all the basics

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,620
of python and then we'll jump into our Django application.
