1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,710
All right guys in this video we're going to install Python 3 on a Mac and I already have it installed

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,780
but I'm going to go through the process anyway.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,340
So if you open up your terminal and you type in Python dash dash version unless you've already installed

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,060
Python and you have a Python 3 and you've set up your environment variables and stuff you're probably

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,580
going to see Version 2 k 2.0 something probably 7.10 we don't want to use version to you you don't want

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,370
to use version 2 anymore for anything unless there's a specific reason.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:42,930
So let's go ahead and say Python 3 dash dash version and you'll see that I have version 3.7 0 which

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,340
is the latest version.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,070
If you see like not found or something like that that means that Python 3 is not installed on your system.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,550
If you see an earlier version of three then you should go ahead and follow these instructions to upgrade.

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,420
So we're going to go to Python dot org and go to downloads click on 3.7 point zero or whatever the latest

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,300
version is at the time.

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,210
And let's open up the package that it downloads and it's just going to be just a simple installer that

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,930
we click through.

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,270
So let's click continue.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,000
Continue and we're going to agree.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,020
And here you can click install but I just want to show you if you click customize you can pick and choose

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,470
to and to disable like the Unix command line tools and stuff like that you want to make sure all of

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,660
this is checked especially this you want to make sure that Pip is installed which is the Python package

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,390
manager.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,430
It's used to install third party packages including Django.

22
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,470
So we definitely need that.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,460
And now we're just going to click install and you just put in your password

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,870
and it's going to go ahead and install Python 3.

25
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,700
All right so once it's installed you'll see something like this and we can go ahead and close it and

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,800
we'll move the installer to the trash.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,820
So now what I want you to do is open your terminal up and do a Python 3 dash dash version and you should

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,610
see that you have the latest version installed.

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:09,970
All right.

30
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:17,530
So if we do just Python 3 it's going to bring us into the REPL or into the python console where we can

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,830
actually type out Python code and get a response.

32
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:28,060
So for instance we can do the print command and let's just say print hello and we'll run it and we get

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,400
hello as our output.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,330
All right we can even do things like create variables so I could say name equals Brad and then we could

35
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,600
do print name and we get Brad.

36
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,690
OK but we're not going to do too much in here.

37
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,900
Well we want to do is create python files which are files with a dot PI extension and then we're going

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,460
to learn how to you know learn the basics of Python within the files and then we'll jump into Django.

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,190
All right so if we do a control d we can get out of the Python console here and in the next video I'm

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,610
going to show you how to install Python on Windows.

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,270
Obviously if you're not using Windows you don't really have to watch that video.

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,090
But after that we'll start to learn the basic syntax and then like I said move on to Django.
