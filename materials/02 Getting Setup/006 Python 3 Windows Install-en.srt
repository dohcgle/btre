1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,860
All right guys in this video we're going to install Python 3 on a Windows machine.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,860
So we want to go to Python dot org and go to downloads and whatever the latest version is at this time

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,930
it's three point seven point zero.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,330
Download the X-C file and open that up.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,050
OK it's just going to just click run and it's going to be a simple install.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,610
Now really important that you check this off right here this is going to add 3.7 to your path so that

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,470
when you type in Python it's going to be it's going to use 3.7 by default.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,430
So make sure you check that off and then click Install now.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:46,490
OK so it's going to go and go through with the installation.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,060
All right.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,120
So now we see set up is successful so we can go ahead and close this up.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,160
And now we're going to do is open up a Windows command prompt and from here let's say Python dash dash

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,470
version and you can see we have 3.7 point zero.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,560
And if I do just Python enter it's going to bring us into the python shell here where we can type any

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,670
kind of Python commands such as print.

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,350
So I will say print hello.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,760
We can assign variables like name same name equals Brad.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:30,660
And then let's say print name and we get Brad OK and if we want to get out of here we can do control

19
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,270
Z or we can do X it like that and that will x it out.

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,300
All right so that's how you can install Python 3 on Windows.

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,690
So when the next video we're going to start to set up our text editor which is going to be vs code and

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,160
we're going to install the python extension along with some other extensions that I'm going to show

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,660
you.

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,380
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
