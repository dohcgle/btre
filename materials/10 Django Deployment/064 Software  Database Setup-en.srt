1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,840
All right guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,910
Now we're going to we're going to install some software.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,280
OK.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,320
So you want to be logged in as Django admen into your remote droplet.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,250
And we want to first of all update our packages.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,150
OK so we're going to say sudo apt.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,160
You can do app to get if you want but you're now allowed to just do apt and an app to get it.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,370
This is our package manager for a buntu.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,420
And we just want to update case we want to update and then we want to run upgrade which will actually

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,560
upgrade the software upgrade the package listings that we can upgrade any software that we have.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,060
All right so now it's two

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,710
grade.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,840
Yes.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,060
I just want to have the most up to date stuff installed.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,430
And the next line here is we're actually installing a bunch of stuff at once.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,360
So we're going Stahl Python 3 Peppe Python 3 dev.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,790
This dependency here this lib P-Q dev postgrads.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,130
And then this post-grads contrib engine X and uncurl

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,590
unicorn are going to do that a little later.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,880
And that's going to be used to serve up and that's installed using Pipp anyway.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,130
But that's going to be used to serve up our application.

22
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,290
OK.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,570
So upgrade always takes longer than update.

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,890
I'm going to actually just copy this line here.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,800
I just want to grab that just for when this is done.

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,970
Go ahead and run it.

27
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,710
All right so if you run into this right here it's just going to ask about the Grodman the GRUB boot

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,160
menu.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,530
So just just choose the default.

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,140
Ok keep the local version that's currently installed.

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,200
OK so hit enter again.

32
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,650
OK and this should be just about done.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,950
All right.

34
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:19,840
So now that that's done I'm going to go ahead and paste in what I copied which is not pasting in scratch.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,190
Again there we go.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,000
I believe 18.00 for buntu comes with Python 3 the latest version.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,000
But we're just gonna install it anyways.

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,430
And there might be a later version when when you guys are watching this

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,500
OK and then once that's done we can start to set up our database

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,620
and we have everything here that we need to add.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,510
All right so this is done going to just clear the terminal up.

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,970
So now we want to do is go into postgrads.

43
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,440
OK.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,140
Now when you install post-grads you just like with the local installation there is a default user called

45
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,170
postgrads.

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,270
So we want to log in is that so we're going to say pseudo dash you.

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,640
So we're just defining the user of post-grads.

48
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,200
OK and then we're going to do PSU Well right now.

49
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,660
You can see that this is changed.

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,410
We're now inside of post-grads.

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:30,590
So we're going to create a database and say create a database and you call this whatever you want.

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm calling it BTR the underscore Prod. semi-colon there.

53
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,560
Case that you create a database.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,600
Now we want to create a user We don't want to use the default post-grads user I know we did that the

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,640
way we do it I think we did that in local development but we don't want to do that in production so

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,080
let's say create user.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,520
Now this needs to be fixed over here you can see I use DBI user here.

58
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:05,370
I think I just meant it as a placeholder and then down here I use the user Django DB admin.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,610
I think that I'm just going to call the user D-B admin because I think Django D-B admin.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,120
And then the user of the server which is Gengel admin I think that's a little confusing.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,600
So I'm just going to call it D-B admin like that.

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,270
OK.

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,870
And then we're gonna give it a password.

64
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:29,420
So with password and I'm just going to give this I'm just going to give it a password of a b c one two

65
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,730
three exclamation Kies let me just make sure that's good.

66
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,140
Yeah.

67
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,320
And then we just want a semi-colon.

68
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,020
All right.

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,850
So now we just want to alter some roll we want to just set up like the encoding and stuff like that

70
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,020
the time zone.

71
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,260
So we're just going to copy this although I'm going to change the DB admin because that's what I use

72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,930
so it's pay set in and I'll change this.

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,180
I'll change the markdown file for you guys so you won't have this you won't have to change this unless

74
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,350
you want to use a different name.

75
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,880
That's absolutely fine.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,950
D-B admin OK let's grab this one

77
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,880
so you aren't D-B admen

78
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,410
again this is all in the Digital Ocean documentation

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,460
TV.

80
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:43,980
OK snow and all that stuff is that we want to give the D-B admin want to give them privileges to the

81
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,410
beat free prod database.

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,830
OK so going to copy this except I'm just going to change the user to DB admin

83
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,980
so granting all privileges on the database Tiare production or Prod. to DB admin.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,250
And there we go.

85
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,640
So now we can get out of postgrads by just doing a backslash.

86
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,790
So we want to quit.

87
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,720
And that's it.

88
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,430
So now we have our database.

89
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,140
It's as easy as that.

90
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:20,440
So now we're ready to actually start our Django stuff and just like we did on the local machine and

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,460
we want to create a virtual environment on the on the remote server.

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Ok I'm going to set the structure up a little different.

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,860
What I want to do is I want to actually this yeah we need to install that.

94
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,800
All right so we're going to have a folder in our home directory called pi apps because a lot of the

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,340
times you'll have one server and you'll have multiple applications you may have a p p application.

96
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,600
And you know you can route through engine X or whatever.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,070
So I want to have a folder called pi apps and then have our project folder in there and the virtual

98
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,530
environment is going to be in the PI apps folder or not in our actual project folder like it was in

99
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,880
our local environment.

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,010
OK and this stuff is optional I mean you can structure things how you want but that's just just how

101
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,240
I prefer to do it.

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,780
All right so we'll get into this in the next video.
