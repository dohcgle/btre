1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,790
All right guys so up to this point we have we created our local setting's which is just exclusive to

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,540
our server our droplet and we have all the database stuff added one thing are a couple of things I forgot

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,270
to add to this document which I just added.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,490
Now you probably didn't see in the last video is we need to actually run our migrations because that's

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,000
what's going to create the tables and stuff inside of post-grads.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
All right then we need to create a super user just like we did on the local development and then we

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,650
need to collect static because any static files that are in subfolder should be taken out and put in

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,250
a main static file in the root directory.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,700
OK after that we can just test this out with the default Python server and then we'll move on to Unicorn

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,990
and stuff like that.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,710
All right so let's go to our server and we're going to just go ahead and run.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,990
Make sure you're in your BTR project.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,690
We're going to run Python manage dot PI and let's do make migrations.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,250
Now this should actually say that there are no migrations because we shouldn't have any that that that

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,150
haven't been ran so we go ahead and do that good.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,600
No changes detected.

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,090
So now we actually want to do migrate which is going to create our tables.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,610
OK.

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,080
So it's a migrate.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,090
Awesome.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,010
So seeing all these green OK's means that our database is connected correctly.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:30,210
OK so we have arbitrary Prah database and all the stuff should have went in there and did what it was

23
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,300
supposed to do otherwise you'd have a bunch of read errors.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,640
If you do have a bunch of read errors go into your local settings file that we create and then the last

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,700
video and make sure all of the parameters are exact to what you what you did on your remote server they

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,050
shouldn't match your local local settings.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,870
All right.

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,720
And it should give you some some pretty some pretty clear errors as well.

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:59,850
So I want to clear this up so now that we did our migration let's create a super user so we'll say Python

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:08,210
managed up-I create super user.

31
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,320
OK.

32
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,130
So see I don't want to use Django admin.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm just going to use Brad as my super user and email address.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,780
I'll just use Brad at GM now which is not a real email address by the way.

35
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,830
So password Oh do ABC 1 2 3

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,590
password is too short.

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,760
By-Passed validation is fine.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,260
All right.

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,610
So are super users created and then the last thing I want to do here before we open our port and try

40
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,460
to run the server is we need to collect our static files OK so all the static files that are in subfolder

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,620
or apps should all be placed into a main static folder and that's what that's going to do.

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,910
So it's run Python managed by pie.

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,440
Collect static.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,550
OK so 151 static files that's all CSSA all many.

45
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:22,180
You know javascript images even the admin stuff it's all it's all going to get put in the static folder

46
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,870
now.

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,750
In fact if we are less static you'll see even the admin folder isn't there.

48
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,240
All right.

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,720
Awesome.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,780
So now let's open our port.

51
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:39,950
So sudo you have w this is our firewall we want to allow port heat thousand because that's what it runs

52
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,430
on by default.

53
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,920
Excuse me.

54
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,560
And let's try to run our local server.

55
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,470
So Python managed dot PI run server

56
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,600
actually you know what that's wrong.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,190
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,190
We need to get out of that.

59
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,350
So if we look at the the gist here we actually want to do run server and then 0 0 0 port 8000.

60
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,060
So I'm just going to copy that.

61
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,990
Sorry about that.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,290
Let's go and run it.

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,010
All right so now and then I realized that because it said one to 7 it should do.

64
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,080
It should have this 0 0 0.

65
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,140
So now let's take our IP address from Digital Ocean.

66
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,650
Let's go to a new tab and make sure we go to Kolin support eight thousand.

67
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,960
All right guys.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,360
Now one thing I didn't account for is the static files because since since they said debug to false

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,070
in our local settings it's basically saying All right well engine X or whatever we use is going to take

70
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,350
care of static files.

71
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,980
So for now I'm going to go back I'm going to escape out of the server here.

72
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,990
And let's let's do pseudo Nano.

73
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:07,500
And we want to go into local settings which is in the B.T. are the and then local underscore settings

74
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,120
dot pi.

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:20,460
And for now let's set debug to true and hopefully that works so we'll get out of this save it.

76
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes and or.

77
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,760
OK.

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,490
Now let's run the server again

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,400
and reload.

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,050
There we go.

81
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,850
OK.

82
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,070
And you know once once we start to implement unicorn and genetics and next will take care of our static

83
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,660
assets.

84
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,320
But for now I'm just going to leave debug to defaults.

85
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,000
OK.

86
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,920
And notice that there's nothing there's no team members there's no listings and that's exactly what

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,360
we want.

88
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,640
We didn't want to deploy with that data.

89
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,470
We want to deploy as a as a fresh application.

90
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,380
So that's exactly what we want.

91
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,490
So there's no users Let's check the admin area.

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,910
Hopes we don't want to go to listings admin We just want slash admin and let's see.

93
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,680
I used Brad

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,870
as our admin area if we go to like listings there's nothing here.

95
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,940
All right.

96
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,550
So that's exactly how it should be right now.

97
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,970
So let's actually add some data we don't have to add everything but let's make sure everything is working.

98
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,260
So we start by adding realtors so it's good to realtors say add new ones.

99
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,210
Good old Kyle Brown and say Choose file and we're going to go to the desktop.

100
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,100
You want to go to your resources.

101
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,070
Images realtors Kayal description.

102
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm just going to grab some some dummy text from Lipscombe dot com.

103
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,150
Just generate some text here and I'll grab the loops.

104
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,900
Is that right.

105
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,010
Oh what the heck.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,670
Oh I copied the wrong thing.

107
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,380
And by the way this obviously isn't going to be running on eight thousand.

108
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,620
This is just the default Django server.

109
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,600
We're going to be doing a more professional deployment using engine X and stuff like that.

110
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,170
But for now I just want to test out the functionality.

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,600
So phone number.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:42,570
Email Kayal and we'll say is MVP and then hire date.

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,330
Just pick something back here in 2017 and let's save and hopefully this works let's go to the front

114
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,120
end.

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,920
So I'm just going to open the site in a new tab.

116
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,410
Let's go to a bow.

117
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,490
There is awesome.

118
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,540
And the picture shows up everything that's being uploaded is going to the media folder.

119
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,840
That's exactly what we want.

120
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,670
So let's add the other realtors since this is real quick so I will say Mark Hudson

121
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,890
piece that in two for us

122
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,580
Will Jenny

123
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,490
OK.

124
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,610
So now let's go back to see.

125
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,710
We'll go to listings

126
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,200
and let's to add listing

127
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,280
and choose Kyle this is going to be 45.

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,990
Dr. Woods circle see address.

129
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm going to put the same thing

130
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,480
it auto filled for us.

131
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,820
That's cool.

132
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,010
So description not just page Sison price is let's see let's do 490

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:42,620
bedroom's is going to be three bathrooms to grudge two square feet square feet 3 2 9 8 0 and you can

134
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,850
put anything you want here for the mean you guys can just throw some crap in here just to test out.

135
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,810
But you know I just want to have have some some valid and valid looking data for the course.

136
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,080
So lot size to say two point three.

137
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:06,920
And then let's grab the photos so photo main is going to be in images homes home one OK.

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Whoops yeah.

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,140
OK.

140
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,620
So photo one is going to be home inside one photo to be home inside to

141
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,860
re

142
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,630
for

143
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,740
five and six.

144
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,680
All right let's save it.

145
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,250
Let's go to our front end here to the home.

146
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,070
OK there's our feature listing.

147
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,570
Let's go to the listings page.

148
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,700
There it is.

149
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,930
More info.

150
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,640
Awesome.

151
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,620
Perfect.

152
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,320
All right.

153
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,750
So I'm just going to add a couple more here.

154
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,040
Let's see.

155
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:56,180
Let's do the next one let's do Jefferson lane which is Mark.

156
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:05,720
So it's 18 Jefferson Wayne Wilborn price on this is going to be 55

157
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:22,930
bedrooms will be four bathrooms two point five garage one square feet let's say 30 100 lot size 1.5

158
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,910
and then pictures let's do home to that's home inside on home too.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,840
And this one will be home inside one home inside too.

160
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,330
And let's do one more.

161
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,140
OK.

162
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:48,110
So I'll go ahead and save that and now if we go back to the home page now we have our second listing

163
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,910
call.

164
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,410
So let's do one more for now.

165
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,650
So you would do an ad listing and see.

166
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,950
Well do Woodrow street.

167
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:11,800
So this one will be Jennies so be 1 8 7 wardrobe's tree.

168
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,940
I lost my text

169
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,400
OK so see the price for this one looks to five.

170
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,900
Eighty

171
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:36,620
bedrooms three bathrooms two two point five garage it's two one square feet will say thirty four hundred

172
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,700
and lots size will save 1.2.

173
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,790
And this is going to be home three for the image and I'll just describe one of the inside images cage

174
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,260
to kind of hurry hurry this along so let's save that reload and there we go.

175
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,850
All right guys so you can see we're logged in here on the front end because we're logged in as Brad

176
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,850
as the admin in the back end so it's going to show that.

177
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,860
OK.

178
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,670
So now what I want to do is obviously we don't want.

179
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,220
I mean if we left it like this we would have to always have the terminal open and you know you don't

180
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,200
want this is not a production way of doing things.

181
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,310
So this is where unicorn comes in where it will constantly serve it on port eight thousand without having

182
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,290
to you know just keep this caught up.

183
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,250
So you know we will be able to get out of this UPS.

184
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,710
I just do.

185
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,370
So we'll be able to get out of this if it lets me it's not letting me some reason.

186
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,060
Control-C.

187
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,710
There we go.

188
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,010
All right.

189
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,100
Geez.

190
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,020
So now you'll see if I go in I reload that's not going to work anymore.

191
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,300
Obviously that's not a good thing.

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,040
So that's where unicorn comes in and then we want to set up engine X so we can actually serve it on

193
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,020
port 80 so we don't have to go to Colon 8000.

194
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,740
That way the app will just be on this IP and then the final step is to connect a domain name so we can

195
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,730
actually go to whatever BT real estate dot co.

196
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,820
And it'll pull up our Python application and then we're done.

197
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:19,280
All right so we're almost there guys like I said in the next video we just check our deployment here

198
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,280
yeah and the next video we're going to start on the unicorn's set up so I'll see you then.
