1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,840
All right guys.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,560
Now we're going to get into the domain set up and there's actually a couple of ways you could do this

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,920
you could do this through digital ocean.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,270
You can use their name servers.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:16,080
What I'm going to do is just simply add an A record in my domain panel and for the IP address for Digital

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,570
Ocean and C name record for the domain and then we need need to just add the the domain to our allowed

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,400
hosts.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,510
We also want to add it to our BTR project file in the engine X configuration.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,770
So this should be pretty easy.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,710
I'm not sure how long it's going to take to propagate.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,020
They can take up to like 24 hours sometimes.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,170
So what I'll do is we'll do the work now and then I'll just wait a little while and then come back once

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,740
it's done.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,400
But yeah I'm going to go to name cheap that's where I have my domain registered.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,910
Obviously I know that there's a ton of different registers and you may use someone different but all

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,430
the interfaces are pretty similar.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,270
So again keep in mind BT real estate dot coing going to go to advanced DNS and what you want to do is

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,720
add an A record.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,220
OK so I'm going to say add new record a record.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,640
And for those who want to do at the IP address is going to be our Digital Ocean droplet IP address.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,320
We're going to grab that and going to piece that right in there and click the checkbox.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,210
OK then I'm going to say ad See name record.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,320
The host is going to be w w w and I want to point that to the actual domain which is going to be BT

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,760
real estate dot co.

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,700
And hit the check button.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,120
All right.

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,690
And the stuff up here.

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,820
I'm actually going to delete on any of that.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,960
I just want the record and see name.

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:01,440
All right so now let's go to our terminal and just like the the document says we want to add to the

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,570
allowed host.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:12,240
So I'm going to say pseudo nano VTR e slash local underscore settings dot pi.

33
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,570
And we want to go down to a loud hostes

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,810
and put a comma here.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,680
OK we want to put the non WW version first.

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:39,360
And then let's also put the WDW version.

37
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,270
All right.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:50,680
And then I'm going to save this and exit and then we also want to add it to our engine Ex-Files so can

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,870
grab this right here let's do pseudo nano paste that in

40
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,290
and see what am I doing.

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,680
Server name.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,980
So right after server name I put a space in to save BT real estate.

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,930
Obviously your domain will be different.

44
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,380
And then also the w w w version.

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,010
Right.

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:47,570
So let's save this and next thing we'll do is just restart and X and unicorn.

47
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,840
All right.

48
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,100
And now I'm going to go open up a new tab and go to Beati real estate dot co.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,130
There we go.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,370
Awesome.

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,790
Feature the listings for

52
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,980
you know we didn't try to register a user.

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:14,120
Let's do that let's check the E.W. version as well so we don't do it.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,860
Good.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,370
That works.

56
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,580
So let's register a user just to test this so we'll see.

57
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:27,590
Tom Smith Tom G-mail dot com

58
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,730
register

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,690
Tom

60
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,490
awesome.

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,630
Now I'm actually going to disable the e-mail functionality in production because we don't have each

62
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,350
DDP as and when you're in production you should use something like postfix or Centigrade or something

63
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,140
like that.

64
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,060
And I think that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.

65
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,620
So what I'm going to do.

66
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,340
I mean you could submit it now but you get a 500 hour and it would go through like in the back end but

67
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,940
the email wouldn't send.

68
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,030
So there's a couple extra things you need to do for that and I might create another video touching on

69
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,440
that later on.

70
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,260
But for now I'm just going to disable the e-mail so I'm going to go back to my VS code and I'm going

71
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,340
to go to let's see.

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:34,240
I want to go to contacts we used up high and I'm simply going to comment this Pardot right here the

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,570
sendmail.

74
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,890
All right so we'll comment that out and save and then I'm going to push this.

75
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:51,570
So do a get one and it had all say good commit

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:06,920
and it's say disable email and then get push and then we'll go to our server.

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,790
And let's do a get Paul.

78
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:24,740
Make sure you're in your BTR project.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,660
All right.

80
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,200
So we're going to reload.

81
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:38,280
Engine X. So sudo system see T.L. restart engine X..

82
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:46,510
All right so now let's go back to our application here as Tom and let's go to a list go to our listing

83
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,430
and make an inquiry.

84
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,390
So our stuff is already in here by default because they're logged in.

85
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,460
We'll send it in success your request has been submitted.

86
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,060
And let's go to the back end.

87
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,800
So we want to go actually let's check our dashboard first.

88
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,420
OK so there it is and we'll go to the admin.

89
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,850
We get a log in is Brad

90
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,920
and contacts and there is Tom Smith.

91
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,890
Good.

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,880
OK so everything is working except for like I said the production e-mail.

93
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,240
That's something I may look into an ad later on.

94
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,050
But other than that we're in good shape so we can log out here and that's it.

95
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,470
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this course.

96
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:41,080
I know it was it was kind of long in and you know it's long for one project usually have in courses

97
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,350
you have a couple of small projects but I wanted to do something that's a little larger from start to

98
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,350
finish so I really hope you guys enjoyed it.

99
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,090
I hope you learned a lot about Django and how to create applications and hopefully you can start to

100
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,590
create some of your own.

101
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,470
So thanks I really truly appreciate that especially if you made it this far and hopefully I'll see you

102
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,880
in my next course.
