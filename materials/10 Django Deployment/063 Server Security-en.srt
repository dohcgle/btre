1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,540
All right guys so now that we're logged into our server we just want to do some security stuff.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,900
OK so first thing I want to do is create a new user.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm actually going to clear this so.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,590
So I'm just doing command Alpher that are my be control.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
I usually switch my command and control keys when I'm using a Mac.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,730
So if we go down here we already logged in.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,920
So now we want to create a new user.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:31,090
So I'm actually calling my user Django admin because that's really the purpose of this account.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,600
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,610
I mean you don't have to use Django admin if you want to use something else that's fine.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,540
I'm actually going to make this smaller so that we can see both these at the same time.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,300
If I can.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,420
All right.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,350
So let's go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Let's say AD user and I'm going to say Django admin actually maybe we should call it something else.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,970
That's fine.

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,310
Whatever.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,510
All right.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,450
So add user now we want to give this user root privileges OK or pseudo privileges.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,450
Well actually first we have to do a password so let's give the user a password.

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,410
It's the.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,620
All right.

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,560
So this stuff this this will last you for like your name and stuff you can just enter through all this.

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,530
Is this correct.

25
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,470
Yes.

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,620
All right so now we have a new user so let's clear this up and now like I said let's give this user

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:47,810
root privileges so we want to do user mod dash lowercase a uppercase G pseudo K sudo is the basically

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,120
like the root group that we want to put this user in and say Django admin OK.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,350
Now this user should have admin privileges.

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,160
So I just want to show you something real quick.

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,210
If we were to logo.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,140
So if we say X it and we try to log in again so I say as a sage except I want to log in as Jane Gladman

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,100
we get a public key deny.

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,960
OK and the reason for this is because the S-sh he that we created is only for the root user.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:35,130
So we actually have to if you look over here we have to add our S-sh key to Django adman's file an authorized

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,440
keys file.

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,440
All right.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,010
So let's log back in as root.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:54,790
All right so now I'm logged in as true and I'm going to CD into home slash and then Django admin.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,980
OK.

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,330
Actually hold on a second.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,330
Let's do slash like that.

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,330
All right so this is the Django admen users home directory.

44
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,840
And as you can see there's nothing in here.

45
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,900
What I want to do is create a file called authorized keys and then I want to put our S-sh key that's

46
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,260
on this local machine into that file and you can see how how to do that over here.

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,030
So we just seeded into it let's make a directory called Dot S-sh.

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:38,470
So make our DOT S-sh And if you do an ls a you'll see that folder lets CD into dot S-sh and from here

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,290
we want to create an authorized keys file.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,200
Now there is you can use different text editors command line text editors like you can use VAM if you

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,900
want of them is a little complicated so I'm not going to use that just in case you know people are new

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,350
to this which I'm sure many of you are going to use something called Nano which is very easy to use.

53
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:06,880
Now if we do Nano and then name a file like authorized underscore keys what it's going to do is it's

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,920
going to create that file and go into it.

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,320
So I'm going to hit enter and it brings us into that file.

56
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,890
So what we want to do here is put in our key so I'm going to go back to see if we want to go outside

57
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,340
of our server.

58
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,510
So I guess I'll just open up a new tab or just a new terminal depending on where you are using your

59
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,690
software might not have tabs so just open up another terminal.

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,750
Make sure you're on your local machine and I want to grab that that key again.

61
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,380
I'm going to say cat and I'm in my home directory so I'm going to say Daut S-sh remember I'm on my local

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:56,380
machine now and I want to grab ID underscore as a underscore D.O. dot pub.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,570
OK.

64
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,890
And I'm going to go ahead and grab this and copy it.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,370
And let's go to our authorized keys and paste that in.

66
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,690
OK.

67
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,580
Make sure this has to be exact Again no spaces or anything like that and you can't see the whole thing

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,490
but you can see that it is it is added.

69
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,230
All right so now that's added to get out of this you want to do command.

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:30,080
Or I'm sorry control X or yeah control X. It's actually command X for me that's why it's a little confusing

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
because I switch my keys.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,450
Like I said.

73
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,890
So we want to save it so we're going to say yes we're going to hit Y and then we're just going to hit

74
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,640
enter.

75
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,410
OK.

76
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,520
And that should save it.

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,260
So now if I were to do a cat

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,670
authorized underscore keys this would show us what's in that file and you can see that that key is in

79
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,960
the file.

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,180
Ok so now that we've done that we should be able to log in as Django admen.

81
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,360
So we're going to exit the server as root and clear this up.

82
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,710
And now it's to in S-sh as Django adman's and there we go.

83
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,580
And you can see that now actually colored now because they're not as the root and Django admin at a

84
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,280
buntu one so that's exactly what we want.

85
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:26,590
So now we want to actually disable the root log in because it said it's just a security measure so we

86
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,180
want to open up our nanotech said it or add to this file S-sh D-Conn. Feg.

87
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:45,400
So you get a pseudo Neno and it's slash see slash S-sh slash S-sh d underscore config.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,440
OK.

89
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,080
Now this is a config file so we just want to find these two right here.

90
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
Permit route log in.

91
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,430
We want to set to know password authentication we want to set to know which I believe is already set

92
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,230
to know what we want to make sure.

93
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,750
So let's look for permit route log in just going down here right here.

94
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,920
So permit route log in right now is set to Yes.

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,000
So we're going to go ahead and change that to no Okay.

96
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:20,400
And then let's see what else password authentication should be around here.

97
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,480
So password authentication is already set to no good.

98
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,660
So to get out we want to do control X and then yes or Y for yes and then enter.

99
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,720
OK and that'll save it and then we just want to reload the S-sh service.

100
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,740
So to do that we can run this command here.

101
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,900
And if you want to type in this stuff you can just simply paste it in like that and that will reload

102
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,380
it.

103
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,010
OK so now what I want to do is just set up our firewall and I just want to mention that all of these

104
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,000
commands this stuff is all coming from the digital ocean documentation.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,830
I probably should have mentioned that in the beginning if I say digital ocean Django and genetics just

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,530
do that right here.

107
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,930
So if you want to kind of look over this this is kind of the same thing.

108
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,970
It doesn't include like the S-sh keys and stuff like that.

109
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,730
It doesn't even actually is I don't even know if this is the thing I was looking for and this is for

110
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:28,250
16.00 for see send it.

111
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,270
No that's not it either.

112
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't know they have they have all kinds of.

113
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,140
And that's not even Digital Ocean but Digital Ocean has all kinds of tutorials on this.

114
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,800
So if you need extra help just go ahead and search their documentation.

115
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,050
So next thing I want to do we want to do the firewall so we want to run this right here.

116
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,500
So go ahead and clear this or one pseudo.

117
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,080
So UFW app list.

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,120
OK.

119
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,650
So available applications open S-sh.

120
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:15,260
So we want to make sure that open S-sh is allowed so we do sudo UFW allow open S-sh.

121
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,500
OK then we want to enable the firewall.

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:29,620
So sudo and UFW is the firewall and we want to enable it to see command may disrupt the thing that's

123
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,000
fine or say yes OK.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,490
And the reason it didn't disrupt us is because we added open S-sh open SH's the program that allows

125
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,470
us to do the S-sh command into the server.

126
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,230
All right.

127
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:51,610
And if we want to check the status of the firewall we can do UFW status and you can see that open S-sh

128
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,500
is allowed.

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,030
OK so it's as easy as that to a need enable just a simple firewall and.

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,880
And these are steps that should be taken for any server.

131
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,410
It doesn't matter if it's Django.

132
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,460
No J.S. and Ruby on Rails ph P if you're using just a you know a standard of buntu server.

133
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,430
This is stuff that that you should be doing.

134
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,470
All right so that's really it guys as far as like security provisioning and stuff.

135
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,250
For now at least I think in the next video we're going to start to install stuff like you can see we're

136
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:31,400
going to install Python 3 post-grads engine X all that stuff and then we'll start to set up our database.

137
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,110
OK and we'll start to deploy our application.

138
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,720
So I will see you in the next video.
