1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,960
All right guys so now that we're going to start our deployment we're you're going to want to do is go

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,670
to this just file here and I'll put the link in the course if you don't.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,610
If you can't find it just go ahead and google Brad Travers see just Brad Travis get have just in your

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,800
find this jingle deploy file.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,510
All right in this link here is going to give you $10 free so if you don't want to pay anything at all

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,210
to do this just go ahead and use this link.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,020
It'll take you to Digital Ocean and you just want to sign up.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,640
OK just sign up like you would any other site validate your e-mail and then just go ahead and log in

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,190
and you'll see an interface like this.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,800
OK.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,260
So what we need to do now is create what's called the droplet.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,930
OK so we go up here we can say create droplet and a droplet is basically just a VPN a virtual private

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,790
server.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:54,060
It's it's basically just an instance of a buntu or whatever Linux distribution that you choose.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:00,330
So right here you want to choose your distribution we're going to use a buntu 18.00 for now if you're

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,040
watching this later on there's a newer version 19 20 whatever.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,670
I would suggest using 18.00 for just so that you don't run into any issues and it's absolutely fine

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,870
to use an older version.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,720
It'd be fine for me to use 16 right now so choose that and then I just want to show you that under one

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,030
click apps there is an option for Django but it's Django one right now.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,480
By the time you're watching this it may be Django too but I still wouldn't suggest using this.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,770
We're going to do we're going to do everything from scratch.

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,610
OK.

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,190
So let's go down here let's choose the first option here which is the $5 per month.

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,950
So if you use that link I give you you'll get two months of this.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,800
With this package that will go down.

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,840
Who's going to leave all this.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,710
New York is fine for me for the data center.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,360
Now here you can choose to add an S-sh key and then I'm not going to go this isn't going to be S-sh

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,940
keys 101.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,110
I am going to show you how to do it.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,540
But I do have a core.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,680
A crash course on YouTube under the Traverse City media YouTube channel if you want to learn more about

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,650
S-sh.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,890
But basically you have the option to have a key so that you don't have to enter a password from your

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,170
from your computer or it'll just automatically go into the server.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,210
Or if you skip this and just create your droplet you'll get what will happen is you get an email with

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,740
your with a temporary password and you'll log in that way.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,470
But we're actually going to create an S-sh key which is highly recommended it makes it more secure and

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
just easier in general so easier to log in.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:39,410
So what we want to do is open up your terminal now with Mac Linux Windows 10 you have an S-sh command.

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,510
OK so you can do S-sh and you can you can run the you can log in using that command you can create keys

43
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,590
and so on.

44
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,540
If you're on Windows 8 or less like Windows 7 or something like that which I'm sure isn't too much to

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:00,240
many of you but if you are you're going to have to use something called Poddy and poddy gen which allows

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,320
you to S-sh into servers.

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:10,140
I think you might be able to use get Bash in earlier versions of Windows and have access to the S-sh

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,540
command but I'm not positive on that it's been so long since I've used something you know less than

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,720
Windows 10.

50
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,560
So we're going to go ahead and get started here now I'm in my virtual environment inside my project.

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,650
I actually want to do all this from my home directory so I'm going to open up a new tab in my terminal.

52
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,800
OK so now I'm just in my home directory.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,140
OK.

54
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,260
No I'm not.

55
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm still in my project.

56
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,320
I want a CD that will bring me into my home directory.

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,540
OK.

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,190
So don't we just explain how this works when you create an S-sh key.

59
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,370
It's going to go into a folder in your home directory called Daut S-sh.

60
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,760
Now you didn't see that when I didn't ask because it's hidden by default.

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,140
Anything with a dot in front of it usually means that it's a hidden file.

62
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,420
So if I do it and last and then dash a which shows all file all files and folders.

63
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,520
You'll see it right here.

64
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,790
S-sh.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,520
All right.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,750
And even if you don't have it for some reason when you create your key it will create it automatically.

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,980
So let's just see what's in my dot S-sh is going to say current directory and then dot S-sh and you

68
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,420
can see I have I.D. RSA and Id say pub.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
I also have some good hobbies.

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,470
Now when we generate our key it's going to automatically want to name it.

71
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,050
This ID underscore RSA and that's fine and you can do that.

72
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm actually going to call mine ID RSA underscored diod for Digital Ocean because I already have these

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,960
here for something else and I could use these if I wanted to but I want separate keys for Digital Ocean.

74
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:58,080
So to generate a key if we look at our deployments file right here we want to run S-sh Ki-Jana.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,710
Okay.

76
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,070
And then it says hit your all the way through.

77
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,350
It's going to want to create these files like I said but you can rename them as I'm going to if you

78
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,140
want.

79
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,100
And then you want to copy the public key file.

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,090
So let's do that.

81
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,160
So it's an S-sh dash co-gen.

82
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,130
All right so enter file where you want to save it.

83
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,640
So like I said it's going to put it here by default in your home directory S-sh folder.

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,060
I'm actually going to change this to the same location so users

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,910
Brad Traviss slash dot S-sh slash.

86
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,110
Except I'm going to call it.

87
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:46,060
Id underscore as a underscore d o k so for Digital Ocean I'm going to hit enter and what it'll do with

88
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,220
it will create that in the dot pub case of the public and private key Do I want a passphrase.

89
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,740
No I'm just going to hit enter.

90
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,790
And now that should have created it.

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,630
So now if we do an ls in our S-sh folder you'll see I have the DEO and then the Deodhar PABX.

92
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,600
OK.

93
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,770
Now the public key is what goes on the server the private should always always stay secret stay private

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,820
and stay on your local machine.

95
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,420
OK.

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,760
So what we want to do is we want to get that private that public key and put it in Digital Ocean.

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,810
So if you look right here we have a command called Cat and this will basically display whatever is in

98
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,500
this file.

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,990
The public key it will display it in the terminal and then we can simply copy it and we can add it to

100
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,110
digital ocean.

101
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,470
OK so we're going to clear this up and I'm going to do cat current folder Daut S-sh and then I want

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:53,890
the ID underscore PABX underscore D.O. dot dot I'm sorry Id say underscore D.O. dot pop.

103
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,050
OK.

104
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,510
So only put the D.O. if that's what you used if you use the standard IDR say and do that.

105
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,200
So this is our key.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,440
So what we want to grab it from where it starts at S-sh and then it ends where it says locals are going

107
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,640
to copy that whole thing go back to digital ocean say new S-sh key pass that you see we get a little

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,800
green checkmark letting us know what's the proper format and just going to call this iMac because this

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,990
is from my Mac machine that I'm on now and I'm going to add that key.

110
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,850
OK.

111
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,710
So that's it.

112
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,210
Now for your hostname you can name this whatever you want.

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll just call it a buntu say a bunch to one and create

114
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,170
OK.

115
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,660
So now it's going to go through and create our server.

116
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:52,100
It should be pretty quick once it does that we'll have a remote IP address to access it.

117
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,720
I mean this is not going to be anything on it by default but we're going to we're going to put our Django

118
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
app on it.

119
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,390
I mean as you can see it goes pretty damn fast.

120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,220
So it's now set up and this is our IP address.

121
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,870
OK now if I copy this and I go to it

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,720
should just say it should just be like like there's nothing here like there's no web site here yet so

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,330
it can't be reached because we have no web server on it.

124
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,660
No.

125
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,990
No server software no engine X or Apache.

126
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,320
There's nothing on this.

127
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,080
So we're just going to get this page.

128
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,980
OK.

129
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,810
So the next step is I just want to show you if we go to if we click on our droplet you'll see a bunch

130
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,400
of options over here.

131
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,460
You can see or you can monitor your CPQ your disk input output all that stuff but it's not going to

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,370
show up just yet because we just created the server.

133
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,130
But you will see this later on.

134
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:03,660
Also access you can launch a console from the browser if you want power or if you want to power it off

135
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,830
in three volumes you can resize if you want to scale your application and you need more memory or Sipa

136
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:20,670
you can easily upgrade it which is great networking gives you your IP address and Gateway and all that

137
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,310
stuff your backups.

138
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:29,790
So you can make backups you can take snapshots you can destroy it so you have full control of this droplet

139
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,880
or of this V-P Yes.

140
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,310
All right.

141
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,330
Well let's go back to the deployment here.

142
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,730
This markdown file and we want to just try to log in now.

143
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:45,690
OK so we want the IP address which is right here we can just click copy and we're going to go back to

144
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:52,940
our terminal and let's do S-sh and then we want the user name which is going to be route.

145
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,240
OK that's the only user on it for now for now.

146
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,750
And then we want to do at and then paste in the IP.

147
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,570
OK.

148
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,880
So the first time you try to log in you're going to get this message you just want to say yes and then

149
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,230
enter.

150
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,910
And we got permission denied.

151
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,450
OK.

152
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:20,640
So if you get this this right here you might get this if you renamed your key to underscore D.O. like

153
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,410
I did.

154
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:32,610
If so then just try to do this S-sh dash add and then you want to do current folder dot S-sh slash and

155
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,200
then the name of your key which in my case was ID underscore iris a underscore d'Eau.

156
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,650
OK.

157
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,490
No dot pub just just like this.

158
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:41,870
OK.

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,690
Now it's his identity added.

160
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,210
So now I'm going to try to log in again.

161
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,090
And there we go.

162
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,020
So now we're in.

163
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,960
OK so if if you got that public key denied.

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,190
Go ahead and try to run that S-sh ad and hopefully that works for you.

165
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,620
If not you may have to go back and recreate the key maybe you didn't copy it right.

166
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,580
Or something like that.

167
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,230
Maybe there was this because it has to be exact when you put it in that little box and digital ocean

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,810
there can't be any spaces or anything like that.

169
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,320
No no line breaks.

170
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,430
You get to make sure it's perfect.

171
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,710
So now the reason that I know I'm in is a few things.

172
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,840
It's giving us kind of a welcome page here and it's telling it's giving us some information like the

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,920
system load the processes that are robbing the memory usage the IP address and down here it notice it

174
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,370
doesn't say you know Brad traversed or whatever my my computer name is.

175
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,870
It says route at buntu one.

176
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,170
And remember buntu one is what we called our server and you see we have the little hash symbol the number

177
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,210
sign here.

178
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,650
And actually if you look at the documentation that I created in are just whenever there's a money sign

179
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,800
that means that we're running these commands on our local machine anything where you see the number

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,100
sign that means we're on the remote server.

181
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Ok so I wanted to kind of make that clear so you don't run commands you know commands that you should

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,130
be running on your server on your local machine and vice versa.

183
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,580
All right so at least now we know we can access our server.

184
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,520
So the next step is to do some security provisioning.

185
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,740
You don't want to be using your root user like we are right now.

186
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,270
So in the next video we're going to create a new user and we're also going to disable log in for the

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,640
root user.

188
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,030
OK it's really important security steps to take and then we're also going to enable our firewall just

189
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,600
a very simple firewall and we'll take it from there.

190
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
All right so we'll see you in the next video.
