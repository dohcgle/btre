1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,860
All right guys so now we're going to set up engine X..

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,600
And this is going to be pretty easy.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,800
There's not too much to do here.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,750
So we want to create a project folder.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,870
So we want this.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,360
And next sites available Tiare project.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,740
So we're going to do pseudo Nano and then that OK which is actually a file.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,400
And we want to add this stuff into it.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,850
OK this whole server Block.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,360
And basically what we're doing is we're listening on port 80.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,230
We want to put our IP address in here so whatever your Digital Ocean droplet addresses you want to grab

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,890
that.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,180
OK make sure you put your own.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,840
So just delete this and let's paste in that IP address.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,790
And then this is just the option to add a fab icon we want.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,090
This is going to load our static folder.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,490
And this is going to load our media folder and then down here we're just proxying this June Gogg unicorn

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
soc service.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,790
OK so let's go ahead and save this.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,190
Oh yes.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,170
All right.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,250
Now one thing I want to do is set the debug value that we have back to false because remember we set

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,010
it to true just to deal with the static assets with the regular jingoes server.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:31,580
So let's go ahead and say sudo in the VTR folder we want local underscore settings dot PI forgotten

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,290
a..

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,730
OK we're going to set this debug value to false

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,140
and let's save this.

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,890
Good.

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,640
OK.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,050
So let's go back to our document here.

31
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,260
So we have this all in that file.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,190
Now we need to enable the file by linking the sites enabled directory.

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,730
So I want to take our project and link this sites and enabled.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,340
So I'm going to just grab this and paste it in and mine.

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,650
I'm going to have a file exists because I actually already did this off camera but you shouldn't see

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,020
this message it'll just go down to the next line.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,060
So let's save.

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,450
I mean let's clear this.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,710
That's so I mean we can check our engine X installation or config.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,170
And I do.

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,880
OK so everything looks OK.

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:42,570
Now we want to restart engine X. So I'll just say sudo system CTO and we want to restart engine X. So

43
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,220
now we have to set up our firewall now.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,660
Remember earlier we allowed port 8000 and we don't want that anymore.

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,410
We don't want people to access port 8000 from the outside but we do want people to access port 80 and

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,770
we can just use this engine next fall so we want to run both of these let's say sudo.

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,430
We're going to take our firewall.

48
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,670
So UFW and we're going to delete the allow rule that we added for port eight thousand.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,470
OK.

50
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:17,760
And then at the same time we want to take our firewall also UFW and we want to allow them we can put

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,710
a string in here of engine X fall and we'll know exactly what to add.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,860
So that's that next thing.

53
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,610
I mean we could we could probably run the server now or the server is running but we could probably

54
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,950
visit the Web site and so on.

55
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,630
But if we try to upload an image it's too big.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,810
We're going to get an error because we want to increase the client Max body size within the next Khant

57
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,670
file.

58
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,360
So I'm going to just copy this.

59
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,270
So we're going to go into that file.

60
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,800
We're going to go down into the H block and we're just going to add

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,740
and add that client Max body size.

62
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,480
So client underscore Max body size we're going to see that 20 meg.

63
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,120
OK.

64
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,350
And make sure you put a semi-colon and that should do it.

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:19,880
So let's go ahead and control X and save and then we're going to restart engine next.

66
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,250
And we should be good.

67
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,990
I believe so.

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
Let's go ahead and check it out.

69
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,630
So grab our IP address no port 8000 this time engine X is running on port 80 So that's the default HDP

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,470
port.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,420
So I'm going to just go ahead and paste the IP address in and there we go.

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,930
Now you're probably going to have the listings that you added earlier.

73
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,060
I actually ended up deleting them earlier and I I would suggest to do the same.

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:54,260
So going to slash admin because you might have some issues with the media files so you know go to listings

75
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,840
delete go to realtors delete them all.

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,920
And also I'd suggest deleting the photos folder in the media folder in the media not.

77
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:11,170
And so if we do an ls in our projects we have a media folder and if we do an ls media we have a photos.

78
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,870
So what I would suggest doing is deleting the photos folder because once you upload photos they'll automatically

79
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,620
it will automatically create that directory.

80
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:27,090
So let's say pseudo our AM and then we want to add the dash R.F. flag.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:36,590
OK since there's there's actual content in the folder and we're going to do media slash photos and cards

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,720
now for doing LS media.

83
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,910
There's nothing in it.

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,590
So we've cleared all the all the data all of the photos and now we'll go ahead and try to upload some

85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,700
stuff.

86
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,660
All right so let's go to realtors first and I'm not going to add everything I'm just going to add.

87
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,450
You know a couple of Realtors and a listing and we'll test it out.

88
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:09,360
So it's a name Kyle Brown let's choose images.

89
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:20,380
Realtors Kyle Kyle is a great guy shoes.

90
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,210
Number here he male will make MVP and save.

91
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,690
Good.

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,260
Now let's go to the front end of the site and if we go to a bow there is

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,340
Denmark is also great.

94
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,670
All right cool.

95
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:09,380
So now let's do a listing.

96
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:18,420
Let's see Kyle and Stu 45 driveway jumps to 45 drive would circle

97
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,180
say great house with poor

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,400
the 550 bedrooms.

99
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,780
Negative One that's not going to work.

100
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,940
Three two one.

101
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,510
Thirty one hundred.

102
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,130
Doesn't matter what you put here.

103
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,450
OK let's grab from the homes fold there.

104
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,730
I'm going to grab home one

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:07,570
inside grab a couple and save K. let's go home.

106
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,510
There's our listing here.

107
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,030
And we have smaller images.

108
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,670
Awesome.

109
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,230
So everything seems to be working here.

110
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,840
So in the next video where I want to do is connect this to a domain name because obviously we don't

111
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,460
want this as our address.

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,990
Nobody's going to remember this.

113
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,790
So we want to be able to go to Beati real estate dot co.

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,390
And I actually registered that domain name for the purpose of this course.

115
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,540
So we're going to get into that next.
