1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,690
All right guys so up to this point we have our Gengel application running on and Digital Ocean droplet.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,430
Luckily it's not running right now because I stopped the jingoes server but that's how we have it now

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,760
is not is definitely not the way that you want to keep it.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,210
It's not it's not production ready just yet.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,360
We need to add a couple of things here.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,820
So we're going to use something called unicorn or green unicorn which will it's a python HGP server

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,280
if you want to read more into it you can go to Google Korn dot dot org.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,300
And.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,520
So it's a python w SGI HDP server for Unix.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
So we're going to run this.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,060
We're going to let this run our app on eight thousand and then we're also going to put engine X in front

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,700
of it later.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,240
OK engine X is a very popular web server and this will allow us to run it on port 80 so we don't have

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,610
to go to port eight thousand and so on.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,060
All right so the idea here is to install it then we can actually run it like this.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,520
But that's still not what we're going to.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,480
That's not going to be the end result but we can test it and run it like this.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,910
And then after that we need to actually added some config files on the server and add this stuff to

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,540
it.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:12,960
OK.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,930
And some of this I'll have to change because as you can see I still like Django admin as the user wait

22
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,930
Gengel admin is the user.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,610
What is it that I have to change here.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,550
Actually you know what I don't think I do have to change anything.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,580
So yeah that should be good if I do then I'll change it.

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,340
And you guys will have the fresh version.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,900
So let's get started.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:43,650
I'm going to install unicorn with the Pipp package manager so let's go back here to our server and I'm

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:53,050
logged in as Django admin and I'm in my virtual environment so I'm going to say Pipp install Goonan

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,720
Korn

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,760
OK.

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,970
That was quick and then I have right here we want to add it to our requirements task because that file

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,520
holds all the dependencies everything that this application needs to run is in there so we should we

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,780
should put this in there so it's WIPs.

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,570
Let's go back to our terminal and let's say Pipp freeze.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,430
And we want this.

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,530
We want to add this to requirements Dot T x t OK.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,610
So once we do that let's take this line here and this should actually run our server but we may not

39
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,390
see any static files images stuff like that.

40
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,350
So let's try to run it and see what we get.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,130
And notice that this BT Arri this is whatever the name of your your inner folder is so we have BTR the

42
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,950
project is our main project and then BT IREY is the main the main file.

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:02,520
This is where the WS G-I dot PI file is OK so we're going to run that and it looks like it's working.

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,490
So let's try and go to our IP.

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,270
So it's going to copy our IP address as you will obviously be different than mine.

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,960
I still want to go to port 8000 and there we go OK.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,090
So with all these images are showing but you can see that we're missing some some assets here.

48
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,870
So we have to fix that.

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:34,230
So if we go back to our document here we want to stop the server and then we want to deactivate the

50
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,480
virtual environment.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,970
OK so let's go back let's go ahead and stop this and to deactivate we simply say de-activate case.

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,860
Now notice that the van is now gone from the front of this so we know we're not in our environment anymore.

53
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:57,000
So we need to open up this file and this is going to corncobs socket file.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,730
So I'm just going to copy this.

55
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm going to make this smaller and we're going to go ahead and paste this in.

56
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,380
Whoops it didn't copy correctly.

57
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,110
All right.

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,830
So this is actually going to create this goon corn dog socket file.

59
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,220
And we want to grab this right here.

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,410
I want to grab these lines and these all come from that digital lotion article.

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,450
We want to save this so I'm going to do a control x yes and then enter.

62
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,300
So that should be saved.

63
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:45,350
Then we want to open this file this caught guna cornets service so we'll grab that and paste that in.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
We're going to copy this.

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,600
All right.

66
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,860
Now if you didn't use if you didn't use these paths this path right here Home Django admin if this isn't

67
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,200
your user name actually put your correct username if you didn't you know make sure that this path goes

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,100
to your project.

69
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,980
Mine is and PI aps and then Bakhtiari projects.

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,090
Same thing here.

71
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,300
This should actually go to your van.

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,950
So wherever your Vende folder is and then it goes into been going on it will actually create that that

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,130
folder.

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,710
And then I think that's that's it.

75
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,120
You want to use B.T. area whatever your folder is.

76
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,040
Just show you real quick so whatever this folder is OK.

77
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,990
If you've been following along then it's going to be Tiare.

78
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,370
All right.

79
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,050
And notice that's where the W SGI file is.

80
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,880
Remember I told you that that has to do with hosting.

81
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,780
So you know C or your application is available on the Internet.

82
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,080
All right.

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
So this should be good.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,770
Let's go ahead and control X and you know I'll be honest with you I don't know what a lot of this stuff

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,840
actually does but I know that we have to do it.

86
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,530
So now we just want to start and enable the unicorn socket.

87
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,380
So I'm going to copy this run that command.

88
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,590
Copy this.

89
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,140
So just keep this file as a resource.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,800
So this created the symlink.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,150
All right.

92
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,430
Then we can check the status if we want

93
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,850
all right and you'll notice that it's active it's listening.

94
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,280
OK so the unicorn socket is now listening.

95
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,270
Check the existence of the Unicorn starts sock.

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,220
OK good so everything looks looks good.

97
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,030
Up to this point.

98
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,870
So I mean if you get any errors here.

99
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,360
Just make sure that you created this exact these exact files.

100
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,600
Make sure that your configuration looks the exact same.

101
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,150
I would really like to find the Digital Ocean article.

102
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,450
There's just so many of them like there's there's probably like 15 different Django engine acts unicorn

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,300
configuration articles.

104
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:13,290
See let's say a buntu 18 18.00 for Django and genetics.

105
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,700
Digital Ocean.

106
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,840
So is this series here.

107
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,010
Yes yes this is.

108
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,750
This is exactly the article that all of this stuff comes from.

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,420
You can see that re-installed all this stuff logged into post-grads

110
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,730
see where is it.

111
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,780
But this is for a new project you can see this is for creating a new Django project

112
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,310
just trying to look for the configuration

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,960
right here so this is what we just did.

114
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,820
We created this unicorn socket.

115
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,890
This is the code that we put in.

116
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
We created this service

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,570
we didn't actually oh yeah we did.

118
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,540
This is just part of this file.

119
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,960
So this is what the final thing should look like and that's what we did.

120
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,390
OK.

121
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,790
And then checking for the unicorn socket We did that everything looked good.

122
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,230
All right.

123
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:25,060
So now we want to work on engine X so down here you can see configure engine X to proxy pass to unicorn.

124
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:33,860
OK so basically engine X sits up front on port 80 and then it passes it off to Gounod corn which runs

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,820
on eight thousand I believe.

126
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,840
All right so that's we'll do in the next video is start to configure and genetics.
