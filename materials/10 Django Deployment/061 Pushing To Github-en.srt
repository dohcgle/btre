1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,250
Hurry guys so our application is finished at least for now up to this point.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,010
You know we add more features later on in the course.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:16,320
But now we want to deploy our Django app which is no easy task deploying any kind of Django app or even

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,510
like a flask application anything to do with Python is usually a little more difficult and let's say

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,780
something like ph P where you have a lot of pre-made scripts that are included with shared hosts and

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,940
stuff like that.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,980
So Django is a bit more difficult.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,540
So what we're going to be doing we're going to be using something called Digital Ocean which I'm sure

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,810
many of you have heard of they offer virtual private servers they call them droplets but they're basically

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:50,370
just instances of Linux distributions so we'll be using a buntu and we're going to pretty much have

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,420
to recreate most of the stuff that we've done on our local machine meaning set up Django.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,350
We're going to set up post-grads on our remote machine but of course we're not going to recreate all

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,270
the files and stuff.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,010
We're going to use it to transfer all of our files to the server.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,350
All right so before we get into Digital Ocean we want to push our project to either get Hobb or you

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,500
can use bitbucket or get lab whatever you want to use.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,300
I would definitely suggest get Haab especially if you're you know you're not really familiar with this

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,760
kind of stuff and you want to follow along.

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:34,280
So I'm logged in to get hub now and I'm going to create a new repository and I'm going to call it BTR

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:45,470
the underscore project and then let's just say Django real estate Web site.

21
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:51,220
Now I'm actually going to make this private so because I don't want anyone to see this for now I do

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,390
have about 7000 followers or so on get how and I don't want them seeing this just yet.

23
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,930
But I will make this public afterwards if you want to use a private repository you have to pay a fee.

24
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,500
I think it's like 8 bucks a month or something like that.

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,650
So you probably just choose public and then I'm going to do create repository.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,990
OK so now we're going to do is push our project to our repository so I'm going to go grab my terminal

27
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:24,880
here and you can see inside my BTR project I do an ls will see all of our stuff here.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:34,110
One thing I do want to do is just take a look at our Get ignore so I'm going to do cat Daut get ignore

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,120
and just see what's in there just to make sure that this is correct.

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,920
So have Slash media slash static V and V.

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,420
OK.

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,720
So just make sure that you're get ignore looks like this.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,830
All right so let's let's I have now just to let you guys know I've been making commits all along.

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,470
I don't know if you have if you have not then you need to at least make one commit now so that you can

35
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,220
push it if you haven't even initialized the repository just go ahead and say get in it and run that.

36
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,520
All right.

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,850
Then you want to do get ad Daut So that will add everything to the staging area.

38
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,980
Once you do that you want to do get commit dash em and then whatever comment you could say like initial

39
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,800
commit or something like that.

40
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,940
OK once you have that you have it all loaded in your local repository and you want to now add get help

41
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,010
as a remote repository.

42
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,570
OK so I'm going to go ahead and grab this now.

43
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,010
I have my S-sh keys set up with a good hub going to go through that here.

44
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,880
I am going to show you how to set up S-sh keys for Digital Ocean.

45
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,560
But if you don't have your S-sh set up with get Hobb just go ahead and change this to HTP apps and then

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,520
grab this link and you just have to put your get have a username and password but I'm going to choose

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,440
S-sh because I should be all set for that.

48
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:10,040
So I'm going to copy that and go back to my terminal and let's add that as a remote pausa story and

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,480
then we just want to push to the master branch so we want this next command.

50
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,490
And we'll run that and hopefully I didn't forget anything.

51
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,960
And it should go ahead and push our project.

52
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:31,420
All right and if I go back here and reload There we go and I'll add a read me here later on it's going

53
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,890
to leave it for now.

54
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:41,290
So our whole project is now on get Haab Oh you know what I should have put the VS code in in the get

55
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,070
ignored but that's fine.

56
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,860
I'm just going to leave it for now.

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,250
So now that we have everything pushed to get hub we're going to go to this link right here.

58
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,450
I'll probably create a document in the course so that you don't have to type all this and you can follow.

59
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,500
And this is a just.

60
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,840
Ok get objects which is like kind of like a just a text file.

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,810
This is actually a markdown file so it's formatted nicely and this is going to take us from start to

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,460
finish for deployment so everything from creating a digital ocean droplet to creating S-sh keys to access

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,050
it to security provisions like disabling the user setting up a firewall.

64
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,140
We're going to use post-grads of course you've just set that up our virtual environment.

65
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,700
We're going to upload using.

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Get going to have a local settings file for sensitive data and then unicorn.

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,920
We're going to use to serve our project on port 8000 thousand and then we're going to use engine X to

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,860
serve it on port 80 case we use engine X as basically as our proxy and then set up our domain.

69
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,400
Now this document may be different.

70
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,880
What you're seeing may be different from what you're seeing right here because I'm probably going to

71
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,760
have to update it in a couple of places but just follow along with the course do what I do.

72
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,910
And you know we'll get through it.

73
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,040
Deployment can be a real pain in the ass sometimes but we'll do it.

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,020
We'll get through it.

75
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,240
And as far as digital ocean there's a link here if you click this link and sign up using this link you'll

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,780
get $10 free and we'll be using the five dollar plans you get two months free hosting and then if you

77
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,360
want you can you can add more funds and continue with it or just you know not pay anything.

78
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
So yeah.

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,450
So let's get started here in the next video we're going to go through create our droplet.

80
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,920
I don't know if we'll do the S-sh keys in that video or the next one but we'll go ahead and we'll get

81
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,120
set up to start deployment.
