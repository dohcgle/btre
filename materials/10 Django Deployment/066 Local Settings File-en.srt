1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,760
All right guys so now we want to take care of our settings our local settings set up and if you were

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:15,650
to Google and say Django or all settings is there a documentation page.

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,070
Actually I thought there was but maybe not.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,220
Look at this stack overflow file basically.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,450
So we want to create this local settings up pie on our server and have the correct production database

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,590
stuff as well as some of the other options as well.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,080
And the way that we do that is in our settings pie.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,110
We want to put this at the end.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,970
And this is basically just saying if this file exists then then bring it in you know use it are included

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,120
I should say.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,680
And it's not going to exist on in our repository or anything the only place it's going to exist is on

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,210
our actual server.

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,220
So that's that's when we want to use it.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,840
And I have that same block of code right here.

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,430
So this actually needs to go in our settings and push to our pausa Tory and then pulled into our remote

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,110
app.

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,750
OK.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:22,080
So what we're going to do is go into our projects settings file and via's code and go down to the bottom

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,370
here and we're going to add that block of code.

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:34,890
So we would just want to do try and then say from Daut local underscore settings that's what we're going

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,000
to call the file.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,970
We want to import all.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,760
OK.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:47,250
And then we just want to put in exceptions so we want to say except on import error then we just want

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,680
to pass meaning that if it doesn't find that file just that it's fine just do nothing.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,210
If it does then we want to import it and it's only going to work on the production server because that's

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,520
the only place this will exists.

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,970
We're not going to create it here.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,870
We're not going to push it to our repository or anything like that.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,230
So let's save this and then we need to actually push this to get.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:17,310
So we're going to say Get add all get commit let's say added

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
added

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,800
Local Settings import and then get push.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,200
OK so now that we've done that now it's now it's at a good repository we want to go to our remote server

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,210
and we want to pull that down.

36
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:54,850
So make sure you're in your Tiare project and let's do a get Paul.

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,940
All right.

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,710
So let's check it out.

39
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:10,290
I'll just do a cat and we'll go into what is it bt r e slash setting's dot PI and there it is down at

40
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,220
the bottom.

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,100
Good.

42
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,190
So now it's going to look for that local settings file so we need to actually create it.

43
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:24,090
And we're only creating it on our local server we're not creating it here on our on our it's actually

44
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,170
it's kind of weird because they call it local settings that's kind of the convention but it's actually

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,760
production settings.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,590
And some people do actually call it production or prod settings instead.

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,860
But I've noticed that the the common convention is to use local settings like it's you or your local

48
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,650
production server I guess and it can be a little confusing.

49
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,960
But when we say local settings we mean the settings that are on the actual server.

50
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,440
Ok I know it's confusing.

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,780
So let's go ahead and CD into BTR eat because if you look that's where the settings dot py file is we

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,680
need to create long side of that so we're going to say pseudo Nano.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:15,960
And let's do local underscore settings dot PI OK and then this is where we want to put any special server

54
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,420
stuff that we don't want in our in our local repository.

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,110
I should say our get hub repository.

56
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,220
Anything that anyone can access outside of the server.

57
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,510
So first thing let's let's let's look at the doc the docs here that I created.

58
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,310
We want the secret key the allowed hosts database debug email.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,550
So I'm going to copy from our settings up high end vs code are going to go to the top and grab the secret

60
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,700
key exits grab all of this secret key de-bug and allowed whoas.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,490
So when the copy that I'm going to go back to our terminal and paste that in and we want to do a few

62
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,210
things we want to change a secret key.

63
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,080
Now this can be anything you want.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm just going to delete a chunk of this and then just put a bunch of stuff in here like that.

65
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,840
That should be fine.

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,900
And then let's go down to debug.

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:17,940
Let's set this to false and we need an allowed hosts the allowed host is going to be our Digital Ocean

68
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,430
IP address which is right here.

69
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,720
We can just copy it.

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,540
Yours would be different.

71
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,900
And get a piece that in here OK.

72
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,860
And next thing we need is the database stuff so let's grab that.

73
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,890
So right here.

74
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,120
Copy that

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,720
paste that in and then we're going to change this to

76
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,720
see password.

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,290
What do they do.

78
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:59,810
I think I did ABC one to three exclamation user on the server is the admin and the name of the database

79
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,730
is Viti IREY underscore Prod..

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,650
Make sure you have your own your settings match and then e-mail your e-mail stuff shouldn't even be

81
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,310
in this file so I should have actually deleted this but I'll just copy it.

82
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,350
Yes I will copy this.

83
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,430
Delete it and save.

84
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,860
And then we're going to have to push and pull again so.

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,590
But I'll do that in a second.

86
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,910
Let's finish this up.

87
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,110
So I'll paste that in here.

88
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,200
And of course you'd put your password but Amadi of you I'm not going to do that here.

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,590
And that should be it.

90
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
So this file looks good.

91
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,370
I'm going to control X and hit y to save.

92
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,140
And then we go and if we do an ls we have our local settings file.

93
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,770
And just to take a quick look

94
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,780
and that's what it looks like.

95
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:00,960
All right.

96
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:11,770
So let's just quickly push this to get hubs and say Get add all get commit get comments

97
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,090
removed.

98
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,490
Email from setting's

99
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,710
and push.

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,130
All right.

101
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:32,630
And we'll go back here and we'll go see dot dot to be Tiare project and get Paul

102
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,830
and if if your if this was a production app I would suggest using S-sh keys.

103
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,610
Forget hubs you don't have to keep doing that every time.

104
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,770
But I'm just I'm not even going to bother.

105
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:04,510
All right so now that we have our local settings OK so we added all this to our local settings in the

106
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,550
next video we're going to start to do all our jingoes stuff.

107
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:16,360
OK so if we want to create a super user I want to try to run our local host or run our server now to

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,810
do that.

109
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,120
We're going to have to allow port eight thousand in our firewall because right now it will be closed

110
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,850
off.

111
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,770
So we need to open that up to allow 8000 thousand.

112
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,720
All right so we'll get to that in the next video.
