1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,970
All right guys so now that we have prepared our form are in Korea contact form now we need to handle

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,660
the submission or start to handle the submission.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,800
So if we look at our contacts folder here contacts app you are Elle's of one path and that's contact.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,440
And then that's linked to this method here.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,370
So we just want to first of all make sure that it's a POST request.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,870
So we're going to do if

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:36,600
request Daut method is equal to post.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:46,870
But our colon here then for now all I want to do is let's see what we do let's just do a print and we'll

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:55,640
just say hello and we'll just return just so we know that the form is actually submitting.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,440
So my server here once I submit the form we should see how.

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,050
So I'm going to just go back there and reload and make an inquiry.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,200
Kathy's information is in there because we're logged in as her it's just send.

13
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,600
All right.

14
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,310
So the view contact's view did not return.

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,660
That's fine because we didn't all we did is return or we didn't return the HDTV HDP response.

16
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,230
I just want to check the console and there it is.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,770
Hello.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,290
So we know that this is submitting and it is in fact a post request.

19
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,210
All right so.

20
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,270
So back to the terminal here and let's continue on.

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,230
So if it is a POST request then what do we want to do.

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,130
We want to capture the fields right just like we've been doing.

23
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:53,240
So let's get the listing ID and the listing ID was that hidden field that we put But we fetch it the

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,940
same way.

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:01,100
Doesn't matter if it's a hidden field or textfield whatever it is we use requests dot post and then

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,140
whatever we named it which was listing ID.

27
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,570
All right we're going to do the same thing for the other fields.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,980
So let's do see two three four five six seven eight fields here.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,240
So the next one is just going to be the listing basically the listing title.

30
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,300
Then we have the name the contact names is going to control D and change both of these to name.

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,800
Next we have the e-mail.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,330
So I'm going to control de-select the next one e-mail and then we need phone

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,960
message.

34
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,130
OK message use your ID

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,790
and then we want the realtor email

36
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,330
OK.

37
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,310
So we do have some issues here but this should have nothing to do with that error but we'll fix it anyway

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,910
so messages we didn't bring that in.

39
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,750
So up at the top here I'm going to do from

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,370
Django Daunt contrib.

41
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,060
They want to import messages.

42
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,530
Redirect comes in from shortcuts so we'll just add a redirect and save.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,470
All right.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,610
So what I'm going to do is I just want to see if that actually went through.

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,130
So I'm going to log in as Brad

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,570
and we'll go to contacts.

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,830
OK.

48
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,190
So that did not go through.

49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,260
So let's try this again.

50
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:03,010
I mean I still think we're going to get the same error but we'll try it just send that in you're still

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,850
getting that error.

52
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,250
So it's on listing.

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,480
So we're getting listings listing equals post request listing.

54
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:25,430
Let's go to the template which is listing dot aged him out and go down to our form and see listing is

55
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,910
right here.

56
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,620
And you know what I think it's because we have a disabled so let's actually remove the disabled

57
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:48,350
and I'm going to go ahead and I'm actually going to log out and log in as Kathy.

58
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,520
OK so success.

59
00:04:50,520 --> 00:05:00,890
So let's go to a listing make an inquiry.

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,840
I'll say I'm interested.

61
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,670
This Home Page Not Found.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,650
All right.

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:16,950
OK.

64
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,070
So I know I know the issue here.

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,410
This should be listings slash.

66
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,040
So that's no problem and it looks like everything should have gone through with just the redirect that

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,070
messed up.

68
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:35,810
So if I go back and we reload we have to log in as Brad because he's a super user or admin whatever.

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,850
And we should see there she is Cathy Smith So we have the listing the email on the contact date.

70
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,830
If we click on that you'll see the rest of the stuff here.

71
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:54,750
So the listing I.D. the phone number her message Date user ID and so on.

72
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,770
Good.

73
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,220
So we just want to go back and change in views dot pie.

74
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,450
We want to change this to listings slash listing ID.

75
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,330
That way it will actually redirect to the correct place.

76
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:13,910
So let's actually log out of the front end and go back and log out and let's make an inquiry.

77
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,010
So I'll just say like Tom Smith

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,580
you know leave the message blank.

79
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:37,040
OK so success your request has been submitted and this is it just redirects us back to the correct listing

80
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,330
the one that we were on.

81
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,400
And if we go back and go to our contacts which I have to log in is Brad

82
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,890
there is Tom Smith.

83
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,300
I didn't realize he used the same last name.

84
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,640
All right.

85
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,560
So we're now able to submit inquiries whether you're logged in or not.

86
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:07,360
So in the next video I want to I want to make it so that if the user is logged in and they try to make

87
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,860
inquiry on proper the property that they already have it's going to tell them they've already made that

88
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,740
inquiry.

89
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,150
All right.

90
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,620
So Kathy logs in and does another inquiry on this home.

91
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,200
She's going to get a message saying there's already an inquiry.

92
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,950
All right so we'll do that next.
