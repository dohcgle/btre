1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,160
All right guys so we're just about there now what I want to do is make this dashboard dynamic because

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,400
right now it's just static each time out.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:16,860
So we're going to head into VS code and open up the Tiare project and I'm just going to close all of

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:25,410
these up and where we want to go now is accounts and it's going to views up PI and then down the bottom

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,200
we have our dashboard which right now is just rendering each time all file.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,030
Let's open up that as well.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:40,560
And in our views dot pi we need to basically just reach in and get the contacts or the inquiries of

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,070
a certain user.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,800
So and at that users obviously the logged in user which we can get by using request dot user.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,990
OK so that's that's something that is available to us.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:05,580
So right here I'm going to say user underscore contacts and going to set that to the contact model which

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,760
we bring in.

13
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,590
No we didn't.

14
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,540
So we need to bring in the contact model.

15
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:23,660
So say from the contacts app dot models we want to end poor contact.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,360
All right.

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,570
I also want to bring in messages so it's too.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,360
Oh we already did.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,540
Mine.

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,630
OK so down at the bottom here we're going to use the contact model and we want to fetch.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:46,430
So we're going to say objects Daut and I want to do order by OK order underscore by and we're going

22
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:55,430
to do a hyphen and then contact data because we want the most recent first and then we need to filter

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,510
because right now it's just going to give us all of the contacts we want to filter by the user.

24
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,310
So we want to say filter the user ID is the field we want to filter and we want we want to add here

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,340
request using that request object which includes the current logged in user.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,470
And we want the ID perps we want to do dot ID.

27
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,420
So this should match.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,470
OK so any any user ID that has the logged in users ID that's what we want.

29
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,320
Those are the contacts we want.

30
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:38,480
And then right here I'll go ahead and put in a context dictionary and we'll set contacts to say user

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,190
contacts and then here we just want to pass in our context.

32
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,470
Good.

33
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,160
Now let's go to our dashboard dot each team now and let's check this out.

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,030
So

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,230
I'm noticing that we have about Beati real estate.

36
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,030
That's not right.

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,500
So we want to change that.

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,450
Someone in chains is to use their dashboard

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,180
and for this tax rate here I'll just say manage your

40
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,570
BT real estate.

41
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:26,990
OK.

42
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,800
And if you wanted to add more dashboard functions later on you could do that.

43
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,410
So let's see the breadcrumb that looks good.

44
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,970
We do have home about.

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,010
That doesn't make much sense.

46
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,860
Let's let's actually make this the active I mean not the active.

47
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,560
This is going to be the active which is going to be dashboard.

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,230
I must not have changed this stuff.

49
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,620
I may change this in yours so you may not have to do this.

50
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,320
OK so dashboard and then home.

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,000
All right good.

52
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,470
That's fine.

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
So down here.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,210
Let's see if we have welcomed John.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:16,210
Obviously we don't want John for everybody so we're going to change this to be dynamic.

56
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:22,620
So remember we passed in well we didn't pass in user users just available to us so we'll say user Daut

57
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,050
first underscore name and that's the beauty of this of Django is you can use this user object anywhere.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,790
So here are the property listings that you've inquired about.

59
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,010
That's good.

60
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,200
So right now it's just in each team all tables is a static table.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,850
Why I'm going to do is keep just the first table row and I'm going to delete the rest of them.

62
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,220
OK these other two.

63
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,490
And then we want to wrap a for loop around this.

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,270
OK.

65
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,740
So actually we'll do it.

66
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,020
We'll do an if statement first.

67
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,760
We should probably do the if before we even do.

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,070
Yeah we'll put the F right under the welcome actually.

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:13,170
So we want to check for contacts so if contacts k then we're going to want all this.

70
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,530
I'm just going to Tab this all over and see where it is and just I guess just the paragraph in the table

71
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,060
will tab over and then right here we're going to put in the else

72
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,920
OK so else.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,330
And then we want it and if

74
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:40,450
so if there are no contacts let's just say paragraph rules say you have not made any

75
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,030
inquiries.

76
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,390
Now if there are contacts who are going to do all this but we want to loop through them and output each

77
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,590
one is a table row.

78
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,790
So I'm going to wrap this in a for loop.

79
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:06,140
So let's say for contact in contacts and down here going to

80
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,610
and for a tab this over and change these two dynamic values.

81
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:23,360
So the soby contact dot ID.

82
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:35,200
This is going to be the listing title which is going to be under contact dot listing and then view listing.

83
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,670
We want to change this graph to you RL

84
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,420
listing and then we also it needs an ID to go to which can we can get from contact dot listing underscore

85
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,740
ID.

86
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,570
All right so that should work let's save it.

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,270
Let's go back and now we're logged in as Cathy if I reload.

88
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,390
Looks like I have an HMO error here on the CD somewhere right here.

89
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,410
OK fix that.

90
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,000
And now we can see all of the listings that that copy is made.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,650
And we can view those listings as well.

92
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,240
All right cool.

93
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,760
So if we were to do another one like let's say this one here make an inquiry.

94
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,050
Just send it in.

95
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:28,970
All right.

96
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,770
And we go back to our dashboard now we can see that listing.

97
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,180
All right.

98
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,260
Awesome.

99
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,060
So I think that we're done guys I think that we have our application so we can manage listings we can

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,540
manage realtors.

101
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,100
OK realtors are shown on the About page of our Selar of the month of our search functionality should

102
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,820
still work.

103
00:07:50,820 --> 00:08:02,610
So if we say nor would submit that still works surge for let's say whether we have Lexington.

104
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,290
So the search form that should work.

105
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:13,190
We have our dashboard we have our authentication latest listings everything is good.

106
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,350
We have our customization for our back end for admin area.

107
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,570
Recent actions we can manage users groups contacts listings and realtors.

108
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:25,920
All right.

109
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,220
So I think that now at this point we would hand the client the application for testing and what we would

110
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,370
do some more testing ourselves and then hand it to them they could test it out see if it fits what they

111
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,340
want.

112
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,860
Obviously if they wanted some changes they could come back and we can make some revisions and stuff

113
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,670
like that.

114
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,100
But I think that we're good to go.

115
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,310
All right so now what we're going to do is pretend we got the sign off from the client and we now need

116
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,500
to deploy this application to the Internet.

117
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,730
So that's what we're going to do in the next section.
