1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,310
All right guys what I want to do in this video is prepare our inquiry form or our contact form.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,840
So that's going to be in our templates and then in listings in listing aged him well.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,880
OK so it's at the bottom this inquiry motile here.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,590
And there's quite a bit that we need to do here.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,530
First thing I'm going to start with is the form tag.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,220
So we need to add an action to this.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,590
Now we haven't created any or else yet for contacts but we will.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,700
So I'm going to put in here.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,870
Let's say you are Arel and will just say contact

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,190
OK.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,900
We also want to make sure that this is a post form so we want to say method equals post and we have

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,000
a post form in Django we want to make sure that we secure it with our CSR token

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,700
and then this property here is just static.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:09,950
So I just want to replace this with our listing name member in the listing but each team file where

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,440
we passed the listing in so we have access to all the fields of a listing.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,880
We also have access to the user stuff.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,880
So if the if the user is logged in I actually want to send the user id as a hidden input field because

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,250
we're going to need that.

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,210
So let's go where should we go to go right under the token right here.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,070
And let's put an if statement.

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:48,540
So say if user dot is underscore authenticated and I just want to put an else here as well.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,280
OK then we need it.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:02,960
And if so if the users authenticate I'm going to put a hidden input and say input hidden the name's

24
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,460
going to be user underscore

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,030
ID.

26
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:18,070
And then the value is going to be user dot ID now.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,280
Else if then the user isn't authenticated I'm still going to send this input.

28
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,280
OK I'm still going to send it but I'm going to set the value to zero OK.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,580
And this is just going to make things easier for us on the other side when we handle the submission.

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,090
So I also want to send along a couple of other things I want to send the e-mails.

31
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,660
The e-mail of the realtor and the listing I.D. And the reason I want to send the email is because I

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,660
want to send her an e-mail when there's a new submission so we're going to go right under the def.

33
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,700
OK this shouldn't be in the conditional and we want to put an input case is going to be hidden again

34
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:05,450
and name for this is going to be real to her underscore.

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:16,940
Email in the value k so the value is going to be listing dot.

36
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,290
Realtor can remember since the relationship between a real turn of listing.

37
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:28,280
We can get any fields from the realtor model and we want that email so we can do that at the same time

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,960
and want to get the listing ideas as a hidden input some going to copy this down and I'm going to change

39
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:47,410
this to listing underscore ID and of course we can do listing dot ID for that.

40
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,900
OK so now it's Hindle the name in the e-mail.

41
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,450
If the users logged in I actually want the value to display as their name and their e-mail.

42
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,910
So let's go to I want to be in the input.

43
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,680
I'll go right after the class.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,190
And right before the required here and let's put an if statement in here.

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,490
Case and say if user dot is

46
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,720
authenticated and I'm going to put the end

47
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,730
and if so if these are authenticated then I'm going to put a value attribute and that value attribute

48
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,110
is going to be equal to user dot.

49
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,430
What is this e-mail.

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,230
Does the e-mail.

51
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,370
No this is the name so user dot name.

52
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,670
OK we want to do the same thing for the e-mails I'm going to copy this whole if statement.

53
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,250
Go right here for the e-mail pasted in and I'm just going to change this to use your dot.

54
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,630
Email.

55
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,060
Why is this discolored.

56
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,540
That's weird sit like that up here to

57
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,670
class form control that yeah that should still work.

58
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,780
It's just a VS code thing.

59
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,570
So it is at it that's it.

60
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,700
So at the bottom input types have.

61
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,090
Good.

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,390
All right.

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,770
So let's save this.

64
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,510
And first thing let's see if we have any errors.

65
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,080
So if I reload the page we do reverse contact not found.

66
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,830
So basically the reason we're getting this error is because there is no u r l with the name of contacts

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,730
so what we're going to do is in our contacts app just like we've been doing with just about every other

68
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,090
app we want to create a you or.

69
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,890
Py file.

70
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,200
And in this file We're only actually going only going to have one u r l and that's for the submission.

71
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:03,050
So let's just quickly say from Django Daut you are Elle's we want to import path and let's bring in

72
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:11,300
our views so from all import views and then we want to do our u r l patterns

73
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,730
K and we just want one path here and path.

74
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm going just going to make it.

75
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,770
Let's see what are we going to do here let's say contact

76
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,700
contact and that's going to go to views Daut contact.

77
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,420
And let's say name equals

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,050
contact.

79
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:48,870
Now just like with any other u r l file we have to basically include it in the main you or else PI and

80
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,240
we're getting this error because there's no contact method.

81
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,800
Well we'll add that in a second.

82
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,170
But let's go to Tiare or els and we're just going to do what we did with the rest of these it's going

83
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,760
to copy this down.

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,150
And this will be contacts.

85
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,410
It's going to go to contacts.

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,770
Elves.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,420
All right.

88
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,150
So I'll save that and let's create our view method so we'll go to our contacts app and then used up

89
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,180
PI and let's say define

90
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:36,530
contact pass in our request and for now let's just return save that and that should get rid of the error

91
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,800
in the dot pi if I resave it.

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,500
There we go.

93
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,730
All right so now let's make sure that we have no errors 3 load and good if we make an inquiry.

94
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,300
So the correct listing is in here 33 x x circle.

95
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,210
Actually though I'm logged in.

96
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,650
OK so it has the email but it's not showing the name.

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,070
Why is it not showing name at all.

98
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,470
The reason is it's not showing the name is because the user doesn't have a name it has a first name

99
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,950
and a last name.

100
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:21,160
So we want to go down to where we tested right here in the input and we put user name we're actually

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,930
going to put user dot first name space

102
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,580
user dot last name.

103
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,430
Let's try that.

104
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,180
So now if I reload and we make an inquiry.

105
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,650
Hope that didn't work either

106
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,700
oh you know it didn't work because Brad the user Brad doesn't have a first and last name.

107
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:57,160
If we go to users and we look at Brad there's no first and last name so that's actually fine.

108
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,930
Let's try to log in as Cathy and see what works you with happens.

109
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,110
Because for the first name a last name it's not required.

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,420
So if we go to a listing and make an inquiry there we go.

111
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,340
Cathy Smith.

112
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,930
Good.

113
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,220
So in the next video we're going to start to handle the submission.

114
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,300
So I'll see you then.
