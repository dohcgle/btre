1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,630
All right guys so now we're moving on to the contacts part of the inquiry's part of this.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,800
This Gengel project so we need to create an app called contacts so when we go down to my terminal here

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,090
make sure you're in your virtual environment and we're going to run Python

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:30,080
managed up high and we want to do start up and we're going to call this contacts.

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,660
So now over here you can see that we have a new folder called contacts all the standard stuff inside

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,120
of it.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,730
And I think the first thing that we should do here is create our model OK because this is going to have

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:50,130
its own model so let's open this up and let's create a class called contact that's our model name and

9
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,630
we need to pass in models Daut model and Colin and then we want to put our fields so we're going to

10
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:06,670
have listing and listing is going to be a character field so we're going to say char field and let's

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,880
give it a max length.

12
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,900
And let's do max length 200.

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,280
OK I'm not going to do our relationship here between the contact and listing because we don't really

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
need to.

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,910
All I really want is just the title of the listing and also the listing ID.

16
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,010
So we're going to do listing ID and that's going to be an integer field so models dot integer field

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,970
K that we want to name.

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,300
So this will be the contact name UPS models dot.

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,190
This will also be char field.

20
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:51,370
And let's do max say max length and let's do 200.

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,830
All right.

22
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,730
And then I'm going to copy this down.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,330
Let's do two more down.

24
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,660
And this one both of these are going to be max length of one hundred.

25
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,760
This is actually going to be the email on the phone.

26
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,280
So say e-mail

27
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,150
and phone OK so the next thing is going to be the message

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:22,150
and message is going to be a text field K and message is going to be optional so we're going to do blank

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,420
equals true meaning that it can be blank.

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,800
So it's optional.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,420
And then let's do contact underscore date and we're going to set that to date.

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,170
Sorry.

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:45,440
Models dot let's do date time field and I want to put a default in here and I want to set the default

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,220
to date

35
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,960
time do it now.

36
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:02,590
And in order to use the time we have to bring that in so we're going to say from date time imports date

37
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,480
time.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,620
So default now and then I'm also going to add blank true to this.

39
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,240
So it's a blank and set that equal to true.

40
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,920
And then we want also want the user ID.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,820
Now this user ID is going to be connected to whatever registered users logged in when they make an inquiry.

42
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:31,770
So let's say models dot will do integer field and I'm actually going to set this to blank equals true

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,630
because when someone makes an inquiry they may not be logged in.

44
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,610
OK so we don't want inquiry forms to only be available to people that are logged in.

45
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,760
However if they are logged in we want to track that user ID so that we can show their inquiries on their

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,650
dashboard.

47
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,770
Now the last thing we're going to do here is define and we're going to say double underscore to your

48
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,490
double underscore.

49
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,090
And then we want to pass in the self.

50
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,170
And this is the basically the main field we want to refer to for contacts and that's going to be named

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,800
so we're going to do self-taught name and that's it.

52
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,650
That's our model.

53
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:19,780
Now we're going to have we we want to put a table in the database for our contacts so we need to create

54
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,400
a migration.

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,700
All right.

56
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,980
So let's go down here to our terminal and we're going to say Python

57
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:36,310
managed our pie make migrations contacts

58
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,170
app contacts cannot be found.

59
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,470
All right.

60
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,340
So I think I've said this a couple times throughout the course I always forget to put my new apps in

61
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,900
the installed apps list in the settings so let's go to our settings page or settings PI and go up to

62
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,170
installed apps.

63
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,370
I wish that they would just somehow make it so that these got added automatically because I just can't

64
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,900
seem to remember to put them in.

65
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:14,710
So this is going to be contacts config and we want to change this to contacts.

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,090
All right.

67
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,830
So let's save that and let's try this again.

68
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,130
So we're going to run make make migrations with on the contacts app.

69
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,500
I sort of look at that model and will create a migration file so you can see it's created in contacts

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,260
it's created in the migrations folders 001 dot initialled dot pi.

71
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,050
Now to run this we need to do Python

72
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,020
managed up-I because right now we just have that the migration file it has actually ran so it hasn't

73
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,920
created the database table.

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,370
So now we just simply say migrate and we get.

75
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:03,880
OK so if we want to double check that we can go to PGE admen and probably going to have to log back

76
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,440
in here because it's been a while.

77
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,450
And you don't have to use PGE admin if you want to log into your shell your PSU all shall That's fine

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,570
as well.

79
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:29,220
So if we go to databases and be Tiare DBI schemas public tables and there it is contact's underscore

80
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,610
contact.

81
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,030
All right good.

82
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,590
So we know that that worked.

83
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,290
So I think we're all set here and the models are going to close that up and in the next video what I

84
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,200
want to do is I want to register our model with our admin area so that we can actually see our contacts

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,530
in the admin and we're also going to customize the table a little bit.

86
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:52,890
All right.

87
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,750
So we'll do that in the next video.
