1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,430
All right guys so in the last video we went ahead and created our contacts app we created our model

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,180
and we ran the migration.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,640
So now we actually have a contacts database table.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,340
Now we're going to go to the admin dot pie here because we want to register our contact model so that

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,490
we can actually see them in the admin area.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,180
So let's go ahead and bring in we'll say from Daut models.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:44,250
Want to import contact and let's do class contact admin and pass in the admin Daut model admin and then

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,730
we can do our customisations here and then after that we want to run it through admin dot site dot

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:04,500
register pass in the name of the model contact and then the name of the class which is contact admin.

10
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,710
OK so in here as far as customisations Let's do our list display so we've done this before with other

11
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,560
models.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,380
Solist display I'm going to do.

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,360
ID.

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,450
ID let's do name let's do listing.

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,460
OK so that will be the actual listing name email and contact date.

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,510
And if you want to change any of these up feel free to do that.

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,510
Snellius do list display links.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:49,460
Which ones do we want to actually be links and I just want to do ID and name OK let's do search fields

19
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,270
so search fields I'm going to do name

20
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,310
email and listing

21
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,350
and then finally let's do list per page.

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,620
And that's going to be 25.

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,690
Just like the rest.

24
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,320
And that's it.

25
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm not going to do anything crazy here so let's save that.

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,660
And now we go to our back end.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:25,980
We're going to have to log in reload this we have to log in as Bradd or whatever your admin user is.

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,600
And let's go to our home and now we see contacts if we click on that we don't have any contacts obviously.

29
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,630
Now you can add them from here if you want but I really don't know why you would do this.

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,030
I guess maybe a few If like you talked to.

31
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,130
If the company if someone from the company talked to someone outside of the Web site like in real life

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,990
and then they wanted to add their information into the admin area I guess they could do it this way.

33
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,950
But for the most part the contacts that are going to be listed here they're going to come from that

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,490
inquiry form on in the application.

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,590
So that's that's really what this is for.

36
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,330
So I'm not going to go out I'm not going to add any contacts through here.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,320
I just wanted to go ahead and add that those customisations for the admin area.

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,140
All right so in the next video what I want to do is prepare our inquiry form.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,780
So this right here when I say make an inquiry I want to do a few things here we need to change this

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,800
because this is just hard coded right now or just just static each time.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,670
Now I also want to put the name in the email of the logged in user if they're logged in I want I want

42
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,120
that information in there as well as some hidden fields so I want to prepare this form in the next video

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,450
and then we'll move on to actually submitting it and and getting that data into the database.

44
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,360
OK so I'll see you in the next video.
