1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,940
All right guys so our submission for the contact form is going through but there's a couple more things

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,990
you want to do.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,720
I want to make it so that if the authenticated user has already sent to an inquiry that they get a message

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,600
saying they've already sent it and then I also want to add the functionality of e-mail I want to send

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,180
whoever the realtor email is I want to send them an email notifying them that there's been a submission.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,980
So let's start off with telling the user that they've already had eight inquiries so we're going to

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,730
go right here let's say check if user has made

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,310
inquiry already.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:54,270
So we're first going to just say if I request dog user dog and then we want to use that is authenticated

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,430
OK.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,730
So if they're authenticated then we want to get.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:11,770
We're going to say user ID equals request dot user dot ID.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,210
All right.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:22,450
And then after that I'm going to say has underscore contacted and said that to our contact model and

15
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:32,890
then objects dot all and then I want to filter can I want to filter I'm going to say listing underscore

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:40,840
ID equals listing underscore ID because I want to check for the current listing and the current user.

17
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:49,070
So user underscore ID equals user underscore ID.

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,630
OK.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,020
And then right under that we're going to do it if we're going to check that has contacted.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,210
So if has contacted We want to send an error message some messages dot error

21
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:20,390
and we'll just say you have already made an inquiry for this listing and then we'll redirect back to

22
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,250
the same listing.

23
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,100
So I'm just going to copy this redirect down here put that there.

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,900
Make sure it's on the same line.

25
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,530
OK.

26
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,450
So let's go ahead and save that and let's give it a shot.

27
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,760
So let's go back and let's reload.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,020
So I want to log in as Kathy because she already made a list.

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:52,760
What is she called it 20 Giffard Street So Kathy then two three four five six.

30
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:59,250
All right Snel Let's go to that Giffard story and let's try to make an inquiry.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,030
Guys I'm just going to send.

32
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,520
And there we go you've already made an inquiry for this listing.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,290
So let's try it let's go to another one.

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,790
Make sure we can make them to make an inquiry to one we haven't actually done yet.

35
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,420
And that works so if we go to the admin area we're going to have to re log in as Brad

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,200
and she has one for 12 united.

37
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,750
But notice that she doesn't have to for 28 Giffard street so prevented that from happening.

38
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:37,300
So there's no way to prevent an unregistered user from making multiple inquiries on the same on the

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,220
same property unless you add like IP tracking and stuff like that but we're not going to get into that.

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,890
We just want to make sure that logged in users don't don't make double inquiries.

41
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,820
All right cool so now let's do the e-mail stuff.

42
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,190
So we go to Django.

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:04,240
So say Django email and right here the sending email documentation what we need to do is is pretty simple

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,930
we just bring in send e-mail from Gengel call our mail.

45
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:16,660
We simply run sendmail we put the subject the message from e-mail any two e-mails fail silently so that

46
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,620
the false will use the default.

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,620
So you have to do that.

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,220
And then in the settings we have to add some stuff as well.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,480
I don't know if it should be on this page.

50
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,500
We have to add like our e-mail server and stuff like that.

51
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,670
And I'm just going to be using G-mail.

52
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,630
Yes so these are the the variables we need like e-mail host e-mail port things like that.

53
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,330
So I'm going to show you how to use it with G-mail.

54
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,390
OK.

55
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,440
And let's go it's got our settings.

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:59,490
So we're going to go to be Tiare settings up PI and go all the way down to the end and let's do e-mail

57
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,540
config.

58
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,300
So I want to say e-mail underscore host.

59
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:17,520
So our host since using Gmail is going to be s m t p dot G-mail dot com and we want the poor.

60
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:27,390
So it's a e-mail underscore poort and that's going to be 5 8 7 depending on your S-M T.P. server whoever

61
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,660
you are using this port may be different than you want your user.

62
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,660
So email underscore host underscore user.

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,910
All right.

64
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,790
I'm actually going to do this off camera but you want to put your Gmail user and then e-mail underscore

65
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:54,940
host underscore password and you want to put your Gmail password and then we want to set email.

66
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,240
The e-mail underscore use underscore last.

67
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,820
And we're going to set that to true.

68
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,680
So those should be the only options that we need here in order to use Gmail.

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,430
So I'm going to save this.

70
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,970
And then let's go to views dot PI and we need to figure out where we want to put this and that's going

71
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,850
to be I'm going to do it right after we save because I only want the email to be sent out if it's saved

72
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,130
if we put it up here and something goes wrong.

73
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,190
I don't want the email to be sent.

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:39,230
So we actually need to bring this in up top so let's say go right here and we'll say from Django dot

75
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,420
core dot mail.

76
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,730
We want to in poor send email OK.

77
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:59,680
So see I think you should be good here.

78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,060
Let's go down here.

79
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:12,710
Let's do send underscore mail all right and this is going to get a few things so that the message or

80
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,350
the I'm sorry the subject I'm going to say property listing inquiry

81
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,570
and then we want the body which I'm just going to keep very simple I'm going to say look we want quotes

82
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,280
here.

83
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,380
I'm going to say there has been

84
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:46,430
an inquiry for and then I'm going to just concatenate the listing K which is like the listing title.

85
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,510
You could put this in the subject if you want as well.

86
00:07:51,510 --> 00:08:04,890
So put like this to a period and then a space and we'll say sign into the admin panel for more info

87
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,630
and you can construct this and make this a lot more in-depth if you want but that's going to be our

88
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,670
body.

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:19,160
Next thing we need is the the from address which is going to be the the the address we set up for S-M

90
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,790
T.P. which is going to be our Google.

91
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,150
And let's just put it in here it's a junky mail anyway.

92
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,480
Anyway so mine is going to be traversed dot Brad at G.M. dot com.

93
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,820
So that that that is what would go right.

94
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,830
Here's the user

95
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,660
that OK.

96
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,770
Obviously you want to put your password in.

97
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:53,320
Let's see so the next thing we want is we want to put in an array or a list I should say of of e-mail

98
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,010
addresses that you want that you want these to get sent to.

99
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,620
Now what I want to do is use the realtor email right here.

100
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:11,540
So we're going to take that and put that in there and then I also I'm going to send to one of my e-mail

101
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,030
addresses so I can check it so I'm going to say.

102
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,120
Tech Guy info at G-mail dot com OK.

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,980
So just so I can check to make sure it works.

104
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,470
And then we're going to do our fail silently equals falls.

105
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,230
OK so it'll show us some error error messages if something goes wrong.

106
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,650
All right.

107
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,580
So I think I think that's it.

108
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:45,160
So I'm what I'll do is I'll save this and then let's see off screen I'll put my password in and then

109
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,370
we'll test it.

110
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,230
So I'm just going to pause for a second put my password in then we'll go and test it.

111
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,800
All right so I put my password into the settings and everything should be OK.

112
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,820
So I'm going to actually just send in a submission I'm not logged in.

113
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:12,060
That doesn't matter though and it's put something in here so I'll just say like Jack say Jack Williams

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,400
dot com.

115
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,150
And let's just send that

116
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,070
OK.

117
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,130
So your request has been sent.

118
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,980
If we go to the back end was going to log in again.

119
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,730
So there's Jack Williams.

120
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,590
Now I'm going to check my e-mail so I'm actually just going to pull a tag tab off the screen for a second

121
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,030
and just check it out.

122
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,170
OK.

123
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,660
So there it is.

124
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,560
I don't really want to show you guys like my whole inbox I'm going to click on it and then I'm going

125
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,810
to bring it over.

126
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,850
OK so we get property listing inquiry.

127
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,540
And this was not in my spam box it was righton G-mail and has the from e-mail address which is the the

128
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,640
the Gmail privacy dot.

129
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:23,140
And in here you can see it also went to Kayal at Beati real estate Daco which is not a valid email address

130
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,040
but that's what is in.

131
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,460
That's the e-mail address that Kyle has in the system.

132
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,950
So that's who it goes to.

133
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,770
So you don't it's not like it just goes to one master e-mail address.

134
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,840
I mean you could do that but we're actually having a go to that specific realtors e-mail address.

135
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,170
OK.

136
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,220
So like Mark or Jenny they wouldn't get the e-mail because it's not their listing.

137
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,660
OK makes sense and it says there has been an inquiry for 12 United road sign into the admin panel for

138
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,430
more so whatever the listing is will be put here and you could put that in the subject if you want as

139
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,080
well.

140
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,780
All right cool.

141
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,620
So that's all working so we can make inquiries.

142
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,080
It goes into the database and not only that an e-mail gets sent as well.

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,350
All right so that's going to be at.

144
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,540
That's going to be it for this video guys.

145
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,100
I will see you in the next one.
