1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,860
All right guys.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,100
The last video we created our listing model inside models got pie in the listings.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,940
Now we need to create our realtor model K because these are going to go hand in hand we have a foreign

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,420
key of Realtor that's going to be linked to that that realtor models so let's go into the folder of

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,740
Realtors and then open that model's pie and we're going to same thing create a class and we're going

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,250
to call it realtor.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,320
And we also want to extend models our models Daut model.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,100
And then we want to create our properties member ID we don't have to do that's going to be automatic.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,720
Let's do a name.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,160
We're going to set that two models Daut.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,060
It's going to be a character field.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:55,740
We'll give it a max length of let's say 200 K let's do a photo.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
OK so each realtor should have one photo.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:09,330
So models dot image field and just like we did before in the last video we're going to do upload underscore

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,560
to and let's set this to the same things it's going to go into photos slash.

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,940
And we want to do.

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,030
Percent.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,040
Why slash percent.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,840
Lower case and slash percent.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
Lower case D.

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,920
Slash.

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,130
OK.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:37,290
Next thing is the description description is going to be models dot textfield and I want this to be

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,430
optional so we're going to say blank equals true.

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,840
Next thing is the phone

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,770
so phone is going to be a char field will do max length.

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,650
He calls say 20.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,220
OK.

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,210
Next is going to be the email I'm going to do 50 for the e-mail

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,330
OK.

31
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,140
Next is going to be is MVP.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,870
So this is this will be checked off if they're going to be the seller of the month.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,680
This is going to be a boolean field case a Boolean field.

34
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,010
And we also want to set a default OK.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Default is going to be false.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,800
All right let's see let's do hire date.

37
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,840
So hire date models dot date time field.

38
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,840
And just like we did in the other model I want the current date and time so we need to actually bring

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,070
in.

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:03:02,260
We'll say from the time imports date time and then we can simply say default equals date time Daut now.

41
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,500
And I'm also going to do a blank equals true here.

42
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,320
All right.

43
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,110
And then just like we did with the listings we want to have like a main field for the realtor and I'm

44
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:19,790
going to use their name so let's say I define double underscore as to your double underscore pasand

45
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,670
self.

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,420
And we're going to say return

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,790
self Daut and then whatever field we want which is going to be name.

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,410
All right so let's save that.

49
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,330
So we now created our realtor model now this error we have here if I just resave this that now goes

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,630
away because realtor now exists in the realtors models.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,360
OK.

52
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:52,290
So we just created so now that we have the realtors and the listings models done.

53
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,230
Now we want to get the stuff into the database right now it's not in the database if we if we look even

54
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,590
though we've saved the model it's go ahead and reload and it's kind of a pain because you get to navigate

55
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,270
back down but I just want to prove to you that just because we created the models it doesn't mean that

56
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:18,720
those tables are created you'll see there's no new tables for listings or realtors so we need to create

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,890
a migration or make a migration and then run it.

58
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,500
OK.

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:31,620
So let's head over to vs code and I'm just going to make this make this a little bigger here and let's

60
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,020
see say we want to run Python

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,330
manage dot PI and there's a command called Make migrations.

62
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,720
All right.

63
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,700
Now this make migrations is going to actually create a file.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,710
This this itself is not going to do anything in the database.

65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,220
It's simply good to create the file that we can run to then update the database and notice that in the

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,950
listings folder there's a migration folder which is empty aside from cache pie cache.

67
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,220
Same thing with realtors has migrations.

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,970
So what this will do is create a file that will get set that will get put in there based on the model.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,400
So if I run this OK.

70
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,940
So the reason that we're getting this error is because in order to use image field which we've used

71
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,600
plenty of times here we need to have a dependency called pillow case that we need to install with Pip.

72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:43,360
So to fix this we simply run make sure you're in your virtual environment and run Pipp install pelo.

73
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,520
All right so now that we've done that let's do the make migrations again and notice that it's not only

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,560
did it do listings.

75
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,540
Now we could have done.

76
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,230
And I actually meant to do make migrations listings but it doesn't matter is since Realtors is a foreign

77
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,760
key on listings they both would have ran.

78
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,100
OK but if we do make migrations it'll just run all of them.

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,270
OK both of them.

80
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,730
And it's created a file called 0 0 1 underscore initial dot pi.

81
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,810
Inside both migrations folders.

82
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,680
OK.

83
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,520
Now if we take a look at these files this is what migrations look like.

84
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,320
OK.

85
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,150
And they include this.

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:34,330
This operations lists with migrations daquiri model has a name and then it has all the fields OK.

87
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,900
So this is basically what's going to be read into the database.

88
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,280
Now there's actually a command that we can run to check out what the query would look like.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:51,460
So if we do or what it will look like we'll say Python managed dot PI and we can actually do this isn't

90
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,240
something you have to do.

91
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm just showing you it's an option we can say Eskew Well migrates listings.

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,370
So we'll say listings and then the number of the file which is 0 0 0 or 1 and it will actually show

93
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,040
us the rescue well so create table and soon to be called listings underscore listings because it's the

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,660
name of the app underscore the name of the model.

95
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,760
And then you can see it gives it an ID serial which means it's going to be auto increment in postgrads

96
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:30,890
we have something called serial titles going to be var char char as did the actual post-grads type.

97
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,580
OK we have char field which is the model type.

98
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,060
The Django modeled type of the field.

99
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,680
But this is the actual database field.

100
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,630
OK.

101
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,890
So you can see the actual rescue Allen didn't run this it didn't do anything it's just simply showing

102
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,950
us what it will what it will do.

103
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,160
OK so don't think that you have to run that command.

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,800
So let's clear this up and now it's actually do the migrate.

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:03,370
So whenever we have migrations up and up and ready we can simply do Python manage dot PI and then migrate

106
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,230
when we get to OK's from realtors enlisting.

107
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:16,000
So now that that specific command actually changed the database added the table so let's take a look

108
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:24,130
let's go to PGE admin or you can open your terminal you or you'll have to reload this and then just

109
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,910
navigate back down to it.

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:38,540
So be Tiare the scheme is public tables and there are listings underscore listing and realtors underscore

111
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,450
realtor.

112
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,940
OK so our tables are now there and if we look at it I mean we can look at the we could look at the data.

113
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,500
There is no data but we can say like all rows and it would show us all the data that's in there.

114
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,520
OK but you can see we have the ID which is the primary key title address city all the different fields.

115
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,890
So pretty cool.

116
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,610
All right.

117
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,580
So our database is all set.

118
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,030
The next thing we're going to do is work on our admin area.

119
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,350
Now that we have the database tables in place we want to make it so that we can actually add data you

120
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,860
know Update Delete whatever so that's what we're going to get into in the next section.
