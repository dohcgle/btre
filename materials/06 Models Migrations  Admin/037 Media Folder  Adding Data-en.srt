1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,860
All right guys so we're going to be adding some data here just to work with.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,530
I and I would suggest that you follow along and you add these realtors and these listings and stuff

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,680
just so we're all on the same page.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,720
But before we do that we just need to define some stuff for the media folder where the photos will get

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,410
uploaded.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,540
So I'm going to go into VS code closes up and I want to open up my settings files so be Tiare settings.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,360
PI.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,680
We're gonna go down to the very bottom here and we need to set some stuff just like we did with the

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,010
static files.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:47,610
So I'm going to go right here and I'm going to say put a comment and say media or media folder settings

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,580
and we want to define a media underscore route.

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,770
OK so I want this to be just in the root folder called media.

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,520
So we're just like we did before OS stock path dot join.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:08,750
OK we want to pass in our base underscore Diyar base directory and then a folder called media.

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:17,460
All right and then we just want to set our media underscore you are l and set that to media K or slash

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,270
media slash just like we did with the static.

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,270
All right let's save that now.

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,120
One other thing we have to do in order for our images to show up is we have to go to our core BT houri

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,370
folder here you are housed up high.

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,350
So the main you are Elle's dot pie and we just want to add onto this.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,920
We want to say plus static.

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:51,730
And then we want to pass in here settings Daut and then media underscore you Arel which we just defined.

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:02:00,060
And then a second parameter of document is that right you document underscore Roueche and we want to

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,560
set that to settings so our settings file and then media underscore route.

25
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,430
Okay so these are things that we just defined if we don't do that.

26
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,920
The that's not that things aren't going to show up correctly.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Now we're getting an error here because it doesn't know what static is.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,790
We actually have to bring that in.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,020
We also have to bring in settings.

30
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,140
So right above here is we'll go right here we'll say from Django.

31
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,620
It's going to be Django dot com.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,380
We want to in port settings.

33
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,550
Okay.

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:47,550
And then we also want to bring in I want to say from jingo dot com dot.

35
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,470
You are Elle's dot static.

36
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,020
We want to import static.

37
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,920
All right so if I save that now those errors go away.

38
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,420
Okay.

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,630
So just a little something that you need to do for the media files to show up in the front end but you

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,960
know we're not we're not even dealing with looking at the front end yet are showing listings or anything

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,070
we're just dealing with the admin area.

42
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,960
But I wanted to get this over with.

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,600
All right.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,890
So make sure we do that let's close that up and let's go back to our admen area.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,870
All right now first thing I want to do is add some realtors So let's go to realtors ad realtor and we're

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:33,420
going to add Kayal Brown and we're going to go ahead and choose his image which is going to be on my

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,340
desktop.

48
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,530
It's going to be in your resources images realtors and Kayal.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,580
OK.

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:50,640
For a description I'm just going to go to Lipps some lips some dot com and just generate some dummy

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,700
text here.

52
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,040
So I will say generate larm some mental just grab like like up to here.

53
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,870
OK we'll go back paste that in.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:14,760
And then phone I'm going to say let's do 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 and then e-mail.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,090
Let's do Kayal at the T.

56
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,690
Real estate dot co.

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,250
And then hire day.

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,040
I'm just going to say this is a fairly new company.

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,820
Well so he was hired in like 2017 and then we'll save.

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,530
OK so now we have Kyle Brown.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,420
Now one thing I want to mention is the reason we're seeing his name like this under realtor is because

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,900
of when we were creating the model for realtor we added this right here.

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,460
OK.

64
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,570
Otherwise he would say like realtor object 1 or something weird like that.

65
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,650
So that's why this is this is pretty important to have here and it's like that in other places as well

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,170
like on the listings page when we choose a realtor.

67
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,580
Let me just show you real quick if you go to listings and we add a listing it has his name it wouldn't

68
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,100
be like that if we didn't have if we didn't add that that function.

69
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,250
So just keep that in mind.

70
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,420
So let's go back to realtors and let's add the other two.

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,770
So let's say who else did we have we have Mark.

72
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,250
So I think it was Mark

73
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,400
what was his name.

74
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,930
It was his last name.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,420
You know what.

76
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,490
Let's I'm just going to open up the theme real quick.

77
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,560
So desktop that's the theme.

78
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,640
And Destino Let's go to the About page.

79
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,210
OK.

80
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,660
So this is just the static aged him out.

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,500
Mark Hudson That's right.

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:05:59,800
All right.

83
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:11,120
So go back here and say Mark Hudson description I'm just going to grab that same block of text and phone

84
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,200
number let's 2 4 4 4

85
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:26,550
and IMAO will saying Mark say Mark at P-T real estate dot co.

86
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,500
And as for hire date let's say and say Mark is fairly new and will save.

87
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,650
OK.

88
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,800
So the last one is going to be Jenny Johnson.

89
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,100
Grab her picture.

90
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,470
OK paste in the same text to get a copy.

91
00:06:49,470 --> 00:07:06,100
Again and then phone number will be off threes and e-mails is going to be Jenee at BT real estate CO.

92
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,590
That's it.

93
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,650
Let's let's make her hired a

94
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:20,240
say she's been there for a while since it started so now we want to add some listings so let's go to

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,840
listings.

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,880
We can actually just click add right here OK we'll choose.

97
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,900
Let's take a look at the theme.

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,580
These are just the theme files and let's add 45.

99
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,600
Dr would circle k and Norwood's.

100
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,770
So let's choose Kayal Kyle I'll say 45.

101
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,080
Dr. words circle.

102
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,330
So that's going to be the title.

103
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,410
It's also going to be the address.

104
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:48,740
All right.

105
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,800
And that's going to be in Norwood mass and zip code.

106
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:03,650
So actually put like the real zip code 0 2 0 6 2 0 6 2.

107
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,800
Just want to make it look like as legit as possible you know the description doesn't really matter.

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,760
We'll just grab the first paragraph here and put that in the price.

109
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:24,140
Let's see the price will say four ninety four ninety one two three four and 90000 bedrooms.

110
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:37,190
Let's do three bathrooms will say two garage C C two and kind of a double garage so we'll do two square

111
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,190
feet.

112
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,910
Say like 3 2 9 8 doesn't have to be exact to the theme.

113
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,450
Lot size it say it's like two point three acres.

114
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,500
We'll choose a main photo.

115
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,450
So I'm going to go to see images homes.

116
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,920
I'm going to choose home one.

117
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,910
All right so that's the main image for the next photo one.

118
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,450
I'm going to choose home inside one.

119
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,090
OK.

120
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,630
This particular listing.

121
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,420
I'll I'll have all six images but they're not.

122
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,920
You don't need to that should be home inside too.

123
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,300
I mean just see home inside to see home inside.

124
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,630
Three four.

125
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,540
And just imagine if you had to program this all yourself it would just take so so much more time

126
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,770
on our go.

127
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,270
6 So is published we want that checked list date is good and that should do it.

128
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,510
Let's save.

129
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,120
OK so we have our listing now later on I'm going to show you how to customize it so we can show other

130
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,300
fields here as well not just the one list not just the name but yeah again this is this is showing because

131
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,700
of that that little function we added at the end in the model if it was in it would just say like listing

132
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,410
object 1 or something.

133
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,750
So let's add some other stuff some other listings.

134
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:16,840
So we have 18 Jefferson lane by Mark a Jefferson lane and we use that as the address.

135
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,970
I know this is kind of tedious and boring but I want this to look like a legit site.

136
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:41,850
So it's the Woburn Mass 0 1 8 0 1 0 1 8 0 0 1 that's a Newburn.

137
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,730
And if you guys want to do different information you can

138
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,260
grab description.

139
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,740
OK so price on this one and these prices might not be.

140
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,860
I mean this is Massachusetts this would be way higher but it doesn't matter.

141
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,990
It's a five fifty one two three.

142
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:10,550
So bedroom's let's say four bedrooms and two point five bathrooms garage.

143
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:18,830
There is a little garage so say 1 square feet I'm going to do 3 1 0 0.

144
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,410
What size will say 1.5.

145
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,380
And then let's choose our photos.

146
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,550
So I want home to for this one.

147
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,290
And let's just let's choose a couple of the SAW do home one

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,460
ups here.

149
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,220
These should be inside home inside one home inside too.

150
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,720
And let's do home inside three so we'll pretend we only have three for this and then everything else

151
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,990
is good so let's save that good let's add another one.

152
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:57,270
So this one let's see we have 187 Woodrow street.

153
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,170
So say this is by Jenny Johnson

154
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:16,350
K title address same let's say Salem Mass.

155
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:30,430
It is on line 1 5 1 9 1 5 let's grab the text for the description price say 580

156
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:45,910
these are very low these areas and let's see we'll do square feet what bedrooms three bathrooms three

157
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:54,350
garage one square feet thirty four lot size.

158
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:03,160
We'll just do one Agere photo let's do home three let's do photo.

159
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,880
And if you want to just eat them you have to watch the rest of this video if you just want to add the

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,960
rest of these homes.

161
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,890
That's fine.

162
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,140
Let's see if we get home inside one let's do home inside to home.

163
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:25,030
Inside three will do for home inside for OK save.

164
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,030
And another one we have see 28 Giffard street in Bedford New Hampshire.

165
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,520
So this will be Mark's

166
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,990
different street.

167
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,840
It's bad for Stu and H.

168
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,030
New Hampshire and zip code

169
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,700
0 3 1 0 3.

170
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,100
A price is 380.

171
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,590
So a little cheaper in New Hampshire and bedroom's let's do three.

172
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,430
I know this is an exact to the theme but that's ok.

173
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,820
Garage.

174
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,480
It's a two garages square feet.

175
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,990
Let's do a little smaller mostly twenty nine hundred lot size bigger lot size we'll do like 4.5.

176
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:39,150
And then the photo is going to be what home for I believe right before it's due home inside one.

177
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,850
Let's just say that this one has two images.

178
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,380
OK so we'll save that good almost there.

179
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,620
I know this is really tedious.

180
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,010
So next one is 12 United road in Southampton.

181
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,320
We'll give this one to Kyle.

182
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,080
12 road

183
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,430
and it's going to be so 10

184
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:15,850
Hampshire and 0 0 3 2 7 3 2 7 description

185
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,110
you can see prices to 30

186
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:38,860
say let's do three bedrooms and let's do one point five one and half bathrooms garage is one square

187
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,090
feet let's do 1980.

188
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:55,720
Lot size three point two this is going to be home of home five is right here.

189
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:04,950
Photo on and two and three.

190
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:14,940
All right one more which is 33 circle in Lexington will do will do.

191
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,450
Kyle again he's going to be cellar of the month.

192
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,940
So what was it 3 3 6 circle

193
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:43,750
Lexington and state is mass zip code 0 1 7 3 1.

194
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,770
And then let's see let's get the description

195
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,120
and then the price is.

196
00:16:51,140 --> 00:17:00,470
This is going to be the most expensive one this is 780 bedrooms let's say five bathrooms will say for

197
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,990
garage.

198
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:09,990
One square feet let's do 5 0 2 3.

199
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,550
Lot size do 1.7.

200
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,660
And this is going to be home six

201
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,070
just choose the insides and you don't you don't have to match exactly what I do.

202
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,070
Five and six.

203
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,740
All right.

204
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,190
And we'll save.

205
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,830
There he goes.

206
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Now we have to change this.

207
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,580
And just to show you we can update this very easily.

208
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,780
Just a circle

209
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,500
and go out and save.

210
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:01,410
Also when we choose a realtor here if we wanted to add one we could do that from here too which just

211
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,530
opens up.

212
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,740
If you guys can't see that it just opens up another little window here and we can add a realtor which

213
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,490
is pretty cool.

214
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,560
We can also delete realtors.

215
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,730
We can change the selected realtors So it's it's pretty cool.

216
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,820
It's pretty intuitive for just a standard built in system.

217
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,280
All right.

218
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:26,580
Now that we have all all of these listings in the next video I want to look at customizing this a little

219
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,010
bit because I want some more information in the table here.

220
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:38,010
Also I want to add some filtering options so we could for instance filter by realtor or whatever other

221
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,540
fields that we want just customize it a little bit.

222
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:47,490
Also notice over here we have recent actions so every time we add like a realtor or a listing or whatever

223
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,890
it shows right here which is kind of cool.

224
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,050
Now one more quick thing I know this video is getting really long but when we uploaded those images

225
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,080
let's take a look at our file structure now when to close everything out.

226
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,400
And we now have a media folder that wasn't there before it was created on its own because we sat in

227
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:14,070
the settings media route to this folder and if we look inside we have a folder called photos because

228
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,990
that's where we said the uploaded to photos and then remember the date format we did.

229
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,950
So what it does is it creates a year and it creates a month OK whatever month it is that that image

230
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,050
is uploaded and then the day and all these images are put inside here.

231
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,730
OK.

232
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,480
So if we upload a listing tomorrow it will get put into 0 9 to 5.

233
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,920
So it just keeps a nice structure to your photos.

234
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,310
OK.

235
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,290
So that's that.

236
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,770
I just want to show you that that's how the media files are being stored.

237
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,870
All right so that's it in the next video will do some customization to the admin area.
