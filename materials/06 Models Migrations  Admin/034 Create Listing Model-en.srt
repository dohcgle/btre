1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,240
Art guys so in the last video we mapped out our schemas for listings realtors and contacts or inquiries.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,070
Now we're going to actually create some models.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,160
I want to create our listing model and then we'll create our realtor model and then we'll run a migration

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,880
that will create the tables in our database based on those models.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,410
So this is actually a Jingo documentation link where you can see up here and this is from model field

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,340
reference so when we set up our fields we need to basically give them certain types OK as you can see

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,200
over here on the right have field types and there's a whole bunch.

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,150
We're definitely not going to use all of these but just notice we have like a date field char field

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,880
is for like just that's that's going to be the most common one we use for like the title The address

10
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,300
the city the those will be char fields.

11
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,010
OK.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:01,530
Date date time field email field file field for files and then you also have Image image fields for

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,690
files that are specifically images integer fields.

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:14,440
We have text fields for longer text you are el fields so if you want to check out the documentation

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,990
and actually look into this it's there's a lot of information here.

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,020
OK so let's jump in to vs code and we're going to go into our listings app OK so our listings folder

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,100
and let's open up models dot PI every time you create an app.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,110
It's going to create a model's dot PI file.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,010
So I'm going to just get rid of this and the way that we define a model is with a class.

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,820
So we want to call it class and it should be the singular version of the app.

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:50,730
So in this case listing and then we want to pass in here models with one m models Daut and then upper

22
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,810
case M model.

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,250
So basically we're extending the core model which gives us a whole bunch of stuff to work with.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,620
OK and then we just want to define that class.

25
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,030
And then within that we create all of our properties.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,690
So the first one we're going to create is the realtor.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,710
And this is going to be the I guess the most difficult one because this is going to be part of another

28
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,930
table so it's going to be the foreign key of another table so that we can form a relationship between

29
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,510
realtors and listings.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,680
So we're going to set this to models Daut foreign key and this is going to take in the name of the other

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,600
model that we're relating which is going to be realtor.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,550
Okay.

33
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,580
And then it takes a second parameter of what to do when you delete because if you think about it if

34
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,890
you have a realtor attached to a listing and you delete the realtor What do you want to happen to the

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,020
listing should the listing delete too.

36
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,650
In some cases you may want it to.

37
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,450
I don't so I'm going to actually set this equal to models Daut do nothing.

38
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,540
OK so that will just that that we'll just leave it and leave the listing alone even if I delete the

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,110
realtor that's associated with it.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,420
All right so next thing is going to be the title and this is going to be said to models dot.

41
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,750
And remember I showed you all the different fields that are available.

42
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,690
We're going to use char fields for this which is just a basic text.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,780
Excuse me basic textfield.

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,130
And this takes in a max length and this can be whatever you want.

45
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,730
I'm just going to say 200 days should be longer than 200.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,170
And then let's copy this down.

47
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,780
Let's actually just copy a bunch down.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,480
OK.

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,660
So after title let's do the address.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,330
And most of the most of the time the address and title are going to be the same just because that's

51
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,960
the way that I want to format it.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:52,250
But you could have a different title than the address for the I guess I'll leave that at 200 as well.

53
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,400
OK.

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:01,250
So the next field is going to be the city because the address is just the the is just the street address

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,420
it doesn't include the city or anything.

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:11,760
So we want city we also want state and we want zip code and zip code.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:21,710
I'm actually going to set to just 20 state state to 100 city to 100.

58
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,530
And then after zip code we're gonna do description

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,370
and description is going to be a little longer.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,080
So or can be a little longer so we want to do textfield.

61
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,030
OK we don't need a max length with textfield.

62
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,320
Also I want to pass in blank blank equals.

63
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,250
True.

64
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,250
And what this means is that this field is optional.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,380
OK so it's not if we're in the admin area we're creating a listing and we don't put a description and

66
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,270
we won't get an error if we don't put this in here then it's going to look at it as required and it's

67
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,430
going to give us an error.

68
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:56,980
OK.

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,290
I want all this other stuff to be required.

70
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,060
So next thing is going to be price and price.

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:12,760
As far as the type is going to be in integer field guys who want to do in your field for the price we

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,410
don't need any the parameters you don't need a max length or anything.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,760
Actually you know what I'm going to just get rid of these because then I don't want to just keep like

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,970
deleting max length.

75
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,890
Next thing is going to be bedrooms

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,150
so bedrooms is also going to be an integer field.

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,480
So models dot

78
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,940
integer field.

79
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,200
Let's see if we also one bathroom's.

80
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,530
Now this is something that I haven't mentioned yet.

81
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,880
Firms actually want this to be a decimal field.

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,190
And the reason for that is because you can have you know one and a half bathrooms or two and a half

83
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,650
bathrooms and I want to be able to do like 1.5 2.5 and so on.

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:09,280
So we're actually going to set this two models dot decimal field and then we can pat we can format this

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,610
a little bit we can pass in Max digits and I want it to be two.

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,850
OK so the the actual first number should be no longer than 2 digits.

87
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:25,930
I mean I don't think we have any houses with 100 bathrooms and then decimal places.

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,730
We can also assign and I just want one decimal place so like 1.5 2.5 and so on we don't want 1.5 0 or

89
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,970
anything like that.

90
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,130
OK so that's the bathrooms.

91
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,550
Next is the garage.

92
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:49,600
OK so garage is going to be models Daut integer field as well except we want we want this to have a

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
default value of 0.

94
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,350
OK so the way that we can do that is just say default equals zero.

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,020
So you can see how easy it is to set up our database using a model rather than going into like the post-grads

96
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,620
shell or even something like PGE admen and doing all this you know manually.

97
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,610
So next thing is square feet we're going to do Eskew F for that and Lynsay models.

98
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,190
Square feet is just going to be a regular integer field and we want lot size.

99
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:31,400
So a lot underscore size lot size is going to be a decimal field as well for that for Max digits let's

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:40,920
do lots as well do 5 max digits and then decimal places.

101
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,950
Is going to be one K because it's just going to be Acre's like we'll do whatever 2.4 acres and stuff

102
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,240
like that.

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,720
All right so now we want to get we wondering do the photos now in the schema that we created in the

104
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,760
last video I said it was a string.

105
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,480
But that's that's in the actual database with with Django.

106
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,160
We have different types of fields like we have an image field so that's what we want to use for the

107
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,900
photos or the images.

108
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,320
But in the database itself it'll be a string.

109
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:24,390
So let's say photo underscore main and let's see a photo underscore main and then we want to do models

110
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,000
Daut image field.

111
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,910
OK.

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,180
Now here is where we wanted to we want to define where the where are these get uploaded to.

113
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,920
Now there's something called a media folder in Django and we're going to set that up in anything that

114
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,100
we upload as far as images or files in the admin area is going to go into that media folder.

115
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,300
But what we want to do here is define the folder that we want inside of that media folder so we want

116
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,110
to say upload underscore too and you'll see all this in the documentation if you want to look further

117
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,710
into this stuff.

118
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,990
We're going to say upload to and let's call the full photos.

119
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,130
Now we could leave it like that but I want each photo to go into a folder structure of the date.

120
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,980
So basically like the year the month in the day and you'll see what I mean once we actually upload a

121
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,470
file but the way that we do this is we use the date format of percent uppercase y for year.

122
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,570
Percent lower case M for the month and then percent lower case D for the day and then slash.

123
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:39,870
So that's the this is the location inside the media folder that this this field should go to this image

124
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,980
should go to.

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,620
All right.

126
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,310
We want to do the same for the rest of the images.

127
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,040
Remember this should be 6 6 other images and those will be the little thumbnails that have that open

128
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,340
with the light box.

129
00:09:51,510 --> 00:10:00,240
So I'm actually going to say one two three four five six and we're going to just change the name of

130
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,930
these two.

131
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:11,060
This will be photo one photo to three for five and six.

132
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,490
All right.

133
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,950
And then I want the same file structure here but I want all six of these images to be optional.

134
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,490
OK the main one is the only one that you actually need you don't have to have six other images.

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,700
So what we need to do is just add another parameter here of just like we did above.

136
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,080
Blank equals true.

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,720
OK.

138
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,310
That will make it optional so I'm just going to copy this and then we'll put that for all of these.

139
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,950
OK.

140
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,290
That way it's not going to complain if we don't upload all six photos.

141
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:53,890
OK so now the photos are taken care of what's put on is published OK so we want is published and this

142
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,030
is going to be a boolean.

143
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,330
So we want models Daut Boolean field and then we can set a default.

144
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,280
OK we want that default to be true.

145
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,360
We also want a list.

146
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:16,990
OK so list day are in the same models Daut and this we're going to use a date time field and then we're

147
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,530
going to set a default.

148
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,980
OK now the default.

149
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,770
I want to be the current date and time.

150
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,090
So in order to do this we need to bring in the date time package from Python so we're going to say from

151
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:40,470
date time import date time and then the default will actually take that date time and we'll say it now

152
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,430
which is a property that will give us the current date and time.

153
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,140
OK.

154
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,000
But this I'm also going to set two blank rules.

155
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,960
True.

156
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,050
All right.

157
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
And then that should be it.

158
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,670
As far as fields.

159
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:04,840
Now with arm with our admin area when we have I mean I haven't even showed you the admin area because

160
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,500
we have no models yet to really show you anything but we're going to have a table that's going to display

161
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,640
each listing.

162
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,970
And we need to pick a field to be kind of the main field to be displayed.

163
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:23,520
And what I would suggest here is the title to be the main field to display.

164
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:31,500
So what we need to do is we need to go down here on the same level no tab here just do a def and then

165
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,810
we want to do a double underscore.

166
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:44,250
TR double underscore and then self ok and one indent here and then we just want to return self Daut.

167
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:44,860
Whatever.

168
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,190
Whatever the main field we want to display and that's going to be the title.

169
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,610
OK so make sure you do that and that's it will save this file.

170
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,450
And that's our model.

171
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,930
Now we're getting in error right here because this realtor actually needs to be brought in from the

172
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,770
realtor model.

173
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,860
So up here the top let's say from realtors.

174
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,850
OK we can just access any other app we want by just saying the name of it and then we can get its models

175
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,870
by saying realtors dot models and then we want to import the name of the model which is realtor.

176
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,640
K we haven't created it yet but we will.

177
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,320
So let's save that and you can see it's giving us an error because there is no real term yet.

178
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,740
We have to create that.

179
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,810
And that's what we're going to do in the next video.
