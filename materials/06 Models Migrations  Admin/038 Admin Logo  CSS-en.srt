1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,160
All right guys so in the last video we went ahead and added all of our data here to the back end.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,100
But now I want to customize the admin area says a few things I want to do.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,990
I want to add some more fields to these tables.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,480
I want to have some filters and stuff like that.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,390
But before we do that let's change this up here.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,100
Just Django administration.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,770
I don't think anyone is ever going to want that.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,530
There you go.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,940
At least you want your company name or something.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,590
So we're going to add the logo here the logo that they sent us and the resources that we have in our

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,970
stack assets.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,710
I also want to change up the colors.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,010
I want the colors to match the front end.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,990
OK so if we go see a view site we want to use this blue this dark blue and this green instead of the

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,970
default Jango blue colors.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,910
So that's what we're going to do in this video so let's head over to vs code and first thing we want

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,170
to do is go to templates and we want to create a folder called admin OK.

18
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,330
And then inside admin we're going to create a new file called base underscore site HMO.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,870
OK very important that you call it that.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,150
And what we're going to do is extend the admin template and then we can actually change blocks we can

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,450
add certain blocks including the branding blocks so at the top here let's do

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,400
extends and then we want to do admin slash based on each team.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,540
OK so that's the that's the template we want to extend.

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,420
And then we're going to want to use an image we're going to want to use our our logo.

25
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:52,500
So we want to bring that in from our static assets so we also have to load static and cry now for the

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,500
branding or that where it as Django administration we have to put whatever we want to put in there inside

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,870
of a block.

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,440
And this is going to be called block branding.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,700
OK and then of course you want to end that block

30
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:22,640
and inside here we're going to put in H-1 with an ID of head and we're going to put in here for now

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,110
let's just do Beati

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,670
relist real estate.

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,570
So if we were to do that let's save and let's take a look reload.

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,800
There we go so that it's as easy as that to change the text up here.

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,140
But I actually want the logo and I wanted to be the logo and then just say admin area.

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,270
So inside this H-1 I'm going to do an image and give it a class of brand underscore I am g.

37
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,310
And for the source it's going to be it's in the static folder.

38
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,410
So we want to put our tags and we want to say static.

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,130
It's going to be in the I Am G and it's going to be logo dot P and G.

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,260
OK.

41
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,310
All right I'll just put the company name

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,420
BT real estate.

43
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,210
OK let's see what else we want to put.

44
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:33,400
We're going to specify a height width so to say height equals 50 in with equals 80 k that way no matter

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,380
how big the image is it will still just format it to look right.

46
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,480
And then after the image of say admin area.

47
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,970
OK so save that let's go back and reload and there we go.

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,540
So now we have our little logo and it says addling area said a Gengel administration.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,820
Now for the CSSA if we want to edit that we actually have to add another block down here and we're going

50
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,630
to say block and then it's called Extra style.

51
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,020
OK so an extra style and that has to end.

52
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,140
And then in here we can put a link it's a link.

53
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,090
It's going to go to static

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:32,830
so static and then CSSA slash admin dot CSSA we're going to have to create that file and then I think

55
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,970
that should do it so it's save that.

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:44,990
And let's go to we want to go to be Tiare

57
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,170
and see

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:01,790
radio static success and this create a new file called admin Dotsie.

59
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,070
SS So the first thing I'm going to mess with is the header.

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,280
Ok so it has an idea of header.

61
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,440
And the reason that I know that is because I just use the chrome tools here and use the elements selector

62
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,500
and select this and you see it has an idea of header and you can see the the styles down here.

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,490
So I want to increase the height a little bit to 50.

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:33,830
And then also change the background to are blue are branding blue and also change the colors to white.

65
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,860
I don't want this yellow color also for the link.

66
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,930
This right here.

67
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,300
These are links in they're yellow I want to change that.

68
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,240
This branding H-1 as well.

69
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,350
So let's head over to our CSSA and let's change the height.

70
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,160
So say height 50 pixels.

71
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:02,550
Let's change the background to the value of 1 0 2 8 for E which is the dark blue.

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:12,670
And let's change the color to white and then we also want to take the branding ID and then the h one.

73
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,310
And we want to set that color to white as well.

74
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,370
All right so save that and check it out.

75
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,920
So reload.

76
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,540
There we go.

77
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,630
Now there's a little more space under the logo because we increase the height this background color

78
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,930
changed and that yellow is now gone.

79
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:39,410
All right so see the next thing I want to do is all the links I want to be using me this dark blue color.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,430
So will do that also if we go back to the home.

81
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,420
These are still this.

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,830
This actually now before we get to that let's handle this.

83
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,090
If we take a look at what this actually is it's the div with the class of breadcrumbs.

84
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,240
And if we look in our styling here you'll see div dot breadcrumbs.

85
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,270
So we want to override that.

86
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:12,590
So let's first of all just do a we're going to do all a link and a visited and we're going to say color

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,890
and we're going to set it to this bloke here.

88
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,530
OK.

89
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,090
And then the breadcrumbs will say give Dot

90
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,730
breadcrumbs.

91
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,790
Let's set that background to the green so the green is going to be 3 0.

92
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,050
See a zero save that.

93
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,980
Let's go back reload and now we have that green color.

94
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,780
All right.

95
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,580
See I think that's good.

96
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,830
Actually I don't like the color of these.

97
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,320
This right here this line I could see with that is

98
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,010
that in the brain.

99
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,580
Yeah that's the breadcrumbs link.

100
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,500
So you know what we'll do let's just make that black so we'll say Divx breadcrumbs

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:19,900
links say color then we'll do 3 3 3 and see if that works.

102
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,030
OK but what about this this also these are just these are not the links for those.

103
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,700
Let's do the blue.

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,720
So we would just do color in the breadcrumbs.

105
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,960
So like color

106
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,510
like that.

107
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:52,150
Let's see go and if you mean you can do what you want if you want to experiment if you want to make

108
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,870
them a little lighter.

109
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,400
That's fine.

110
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,350
So now if we go back to home I want to take care of these these blocks right here.

111
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,230
And if we take a look at what these are there are caption tags and if we look at the styling we want

112
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,770
this right here because you can see this is where that background color is.

113
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,620
So we basically want all of these classes.

114
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:26,080
So I'm going to go ahead and copy these and paste that in.

115
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,860
OK.

116
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,100
And we want the background to be green so I'm going to just copy that and paste that in.

117
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,930
And let's take a look.

118
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,560
There we go.

119
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,440
So now it's starting to look more branded more like are our clients branding colors or company colors.

120
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,640
So I just think that's pretty much it.

121
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,570
Let's see if we go to the ad page or let's go to like the listings.

122
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,440
Let's go here.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,400
I guess we can change these buttons if we want see

124
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,770
yeah.

125
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,880
Let's grab this right here.

126
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,010
And let's do

127
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,470
let's do a background of the blue

128
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,090
and then color white.

129
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,940
Screen load.

130
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,490
And there we go.

131
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,670
I don't have a problem with that.

132
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,740
The Save button looking like that.

133
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,410
I mean that's fine.

134
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,750
So I think we're good for the SS in the next video.

135
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,530
What I want to do is customize the tables a little bit.

136
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:04,900
So like I want to have some other stuff here like the let's see what can we put here.

137
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:12,460
We could do some location info like the city we could put the price the realtor things like that.

138
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,380
OK so we'll start to customize a little more in the next video.
