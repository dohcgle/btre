1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,710
All right guys so in the last video we added the logo here in the admin area.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,970
We changed up the colors to match the company branding.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,920
Now I want to just mess with the this this a little bit.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,140
I don't want just the name of the listing here.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,650
I want to have some other data like the price and the list date stuff like that.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,740
So to edit this we need to go into VS code and we need to go to our let's see you want to go to our

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:34,080
listings app and then admin dot pi k where we registered the model and we want to go right here and

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:45,420
create a class called the listing admin and this we want to pass in here admin Daut model admin and

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,190
then we can actually add certain variables here are certain properties that relate to how things are

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,360
displayed.

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,680
But before I forget this listing admin class we just defined what we need to do is pass it in here.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,280
OK.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,650
Or it won't work.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,120
So I want to define what I want in the table or in the list.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,130
So we say list display and you can see if you have a whole bunch of pop ups here of different things

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,610
we can do by let's do list display and we want to just set a set of parentheses and then the fields

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,570
we want so I actually want to show the ID.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:34,410
I want to show the title which already is showing but I want to show that still I want to do is published

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:41,040
and what's really cool when you do a boolean value it actually shows like a little checkbox or like

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,160
an X if it's not published.

21
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,860
So I think that's pretty cool.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,740
Does that automatically shows a little icon.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,050
We could do like those.

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,300
The city and state and stuff like that but I'm not going to I'm going to do price and I'm going to do

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,320
list today.

26
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,190
And I'm going to do.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,450
Realtor.

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,350
So let's save that.

29
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:17,610
I forgot I a pretty or enabled so let's save that let's go back and reload and there we go and see the

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,570
will is published.

31
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,620
You actually have these little checkboxes which is pretty cool.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,080
And I'm going to show you how we can make it so that we can click these here and actually publish an

33
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,360
unpublished them without having to go in.

34
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,310
But first notice that I can't click on the title to get to the page I can click on the ID and the reason

35
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,340
for that is because it's the first one.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,050
But I also want to be able to click on the titles so the way that we fix that is by adding right under

37
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:56,830
this we can say list display links right here so lists play links and then pass in any fields that we

38
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,690
want to actually link.

39
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:09,270
And for me what I want to choose is ID so will keep the ID and then also title OK so I'll save that.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,590
Now let's go back and reload and now we can click on the title OK and you can make any of these go to

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,950
the page if you wanted to.

42
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,930
So let's see we can also filter.

43
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,320
I want to be able to filter by realtor.

44
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,270
I mean we could do like like this.

45
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,520
That I'll just kind of order it by the realtor or by any of these rather.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,120
And that's that's that's some functionality that's included that we take for granted.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,800
I mean it would take quite a bit of code to be able to do that.

48
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:50,400
So if we want to have like a little filter box we could just simply say list filter.

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,280
And I just want realtor

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,370
OK realtor and when we use parentheses like this we just want if it's only one value we want to have

51
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,580
a comma at the end or we or we'll probably get an error.

52
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,260
So we want to do that and reload.

53
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:16,560
And now over here we can filter by realtors say Kyle Brown and only show me Mikhail's properties which

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,820
is really cool.

55
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,310
And you can do this for any any field you want.

56
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,220
But I'm just going to leave it at realtor.

57
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,150
Now I'm going to do is make it so that I can click on the is published icon and it will publish.

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,460
And then of course I could publish it again if I click again.

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:47,400
So to do that we can add in the list underscore editable and we're going to set that to is published

60
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,500
with put a comma because there's only one value.

61
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,590
So now if I go back and reload they're actually going to check.

62
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,780
I forgot they they changed the check boxes so if I go ahead like that it's now unpublished if we go

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:08,580
in here and we look at the value actually because it's not oh you know what we have to save it we go.

64
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,940
Forgot all about that.

65
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,630
So we can publish it again.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,330
So it's up to you if you want to have the check boxes here with the save button you can do that or you

67
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,290
can just display the X's and the checks.

68
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,110
OK.

69
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,860
Now what about searching.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,080
OK so we have a ton of listings here we want to be able to search by certain fields.

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:42,540
We can do that so we can just say in here search fields and let's be let's make search by title so I'll

72
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,790
say title description

73
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,700
address

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,420
city

75
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,840
state

76
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,190
zip code and price.

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,280
OK so will be able to search by that.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,420
So let's save this.

79
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:14,390
And if we go back and reload now we have a little search field up here so you can see we can kind of

80
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:21,200
build like we can really customize this without having to go into the actual Django admen code you never

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,580
want to do that.

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,850
We just have these extra methods that we can add to be able to do this stuff.

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:37,640
OK so if I search for let's say Essex and here it is so we can search.

84
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:37,970
All right.

85
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,930
So let's see just clear this up.

86
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,730
So the next thing I want to do is just define the amount of listings per page because I believe by default

87
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:57,170
it'll just keep going without pagination so I'm going to define right here list underscore per page

88
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,630
and I'm going to set it to 25 and save and that's it.

89
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:12,060
So now that we've done the listings Let's go to the realtors and let's go to admen dot PI here.

90
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,650
And let's let's change some things here to customize this so first of all we need to create our function.

91
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:28,290
So this is going to be I'm sorry not our function our class and this is going to be realtor admin and

92
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:37,110
this is going to take an admin Daut model admin and let's not forget to pass it in here.

93
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:47,030
So we want to also pass in the second parameter of Realtor admin.

94
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,820
And let's set our list display.

95
00:07:51,870 --> 00:08:00,180
So this is what fields we want to display in the table will do same thing Id let's say name let's do

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,290
email and let's do hire date.

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,690
All right.

98
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:21,180
And then let's do the links so list display lengths we're going to set to just ID in name search fields

99
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,760
let's just do.

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,370
Well just to name

101
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:35,780
and with do lists per page and we'll set that to 25 as well.

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,360
So we'll save let's go back and check out realtors.

103
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,080
There we go.

104
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,750
So we have our name email higher date a search field up here.

105
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,360
Good.

106
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,730
All right.

107
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,610
So I think that we're pretty good with the admin area.

108
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,920
We can easily add realtors and listings now.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,420
So in the next section we're going to start on the front end web site.

110
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,590
OK so for featured listings we want to be able to fetch into the database grab the listings that we've

111
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,540
added in the admin area and display them here.

112
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,340
Okay so that's what we're going to work on in the next video and in the next section.
