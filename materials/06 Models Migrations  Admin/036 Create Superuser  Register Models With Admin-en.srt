1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,310
All right you guys know that we have our we have a models created we did our migrations our database

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,730
tables are created for the listings and for the realtors.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,220
Now we're going to start to work with the admin area which in my opinion is one of the greatest features

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,350
of Django especially if you're a freelancer or someone that works by itself or just maybe maybe with

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,250
just a couple other people you don't have this big giant team where they can create a custom admin area.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,350
It just gives you that right off the bat.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,600
OK and you can customize it as you see fit.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,560
So if you make sure you have your server running and if you just go to local host 8000 thousand slash

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,870
admin it'll bring you right there.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,770
Hey it's been here all along.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:50,220
Now we don't currently have a way to log in so what we need to do is head over to our terminal and I

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:59,290
am using my via's code terminal and we need to create a super user if we do Python manage Daut PI health

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,030
and take a look at let's see up at the top here I believe under.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,610
Off you see we have a create super user command.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,690
OK so that's what we want to use.

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:21,240
So let's go ahead and run that it will say Python managed or pi create super user.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,690
So for a user name I'm going to use one.

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,390
When am I going to use this.

19
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,520
I'll just use Bradd but you could use whatever you want.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,200
So email address.

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm going to say Brad at gmail dot com which isn't a real email address but I'm going to use it.

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,680
And then your password.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:56,320
So for my password I'm just going to use 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 OK so it gives me just a message saying

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,210
that my password sucks should it.

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,820
Should we bypass the validation anyway.

26
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,960
And I'm just going to say yes.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,360
All right so now we have a super user so it's clear this out.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,300
And let's go back to the Adwan area and I'm going to put in Brad.

29
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,450
And of course use whatever you put whatever you used and put in my sucky password and log in.

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,820
And there we go so now we are actually in the the administrator area now from here without doing anything

31
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,120
at all we can manage our users in groups we can assign groups and Django case we can add groups with

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,010
different permissions.

33
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:44,290
We can also create and manage users So here's our Bradd user and notice that there is a staff status.

34
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,010
So this is basically this just means that this user is an admin and they can actually log into this

35
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,120
area because a lot of times you'll have users that can log in to the front end of your web site.

36
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,310
But you obviously don't want them to have access to this area.

37
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,160
This is for staff only.

38
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,610
OK so that's that's where is it right here.

39
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,730
So Staff Status.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,710
So you check if I uncheck this this user will not be able to log in here.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
OK.

42
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,320
So that's that.

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,850
Now obviously we want to be able to to to add listings.

44
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,920
We want to be able to add realtors and stuff like that.

45
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:34,360
So in order for that to happen we need to go to our code and let's go to listings.

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,670
OK first we'll go to the listings folder and we want to go to admen pi.

47
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,380
OK so this is basically where we can customize admin stuff for the for the listings app.

48
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:54,500
And I want to register register the listing for the admin areas so we need to do that here.

49
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,370
Is register your models.

50
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:09,870
So I'm going to say first of all bring in my model so from dog models I want to inport listing gay and

51
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,900
amusing listing because in my models that's what I call it.

52
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,720
So whatever you have here is what you want to have here.

53
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:28,520
And then let's see to register it we can say admin Daut site dot register and then we want to pass in

54
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,860
the name of the model which is listing.

55
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,540
And we also want to pass in than actually let's just do that for now.

56
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,470
I think that that will actually work.

57
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,500
Let's save it.

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,460
Let's go back to our admen area and reload and there we go we get listings.

59
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,150
OK.

60
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:51,350
So if I click on listings we don't have any at the moment but they would be listed here and we can add

61
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,000
them notice that we have all of the fields that we added.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,830
Even realtor so we can choose a realtor title address city state zip.

63
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,340
These are all text.

64
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,090
What was it were they called Char fields.

65
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,730
This is a text field.

66
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,480
The price is is an ENT.

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:19,980
So we can also use these arrows just in h t Moul number field and then bedrooms bathrooms can be decimal.

68
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,300
Garage isn't into square feet in lot size is also a decimal.

69
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,630
For some reason the decimal places they give you a longer input.

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Well I guess that would make sense because you may have a lot of decimal points that we have photo main.

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,770
Notice that these are dark and these are not that's because the required fields are dark.

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
And remember we made these optional.

73
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,640
So that's why they're not dark or bold like that.

74
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:52,370
And then is published is a checkbox and by default it's going to be checked because we set the default

75
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,780
to true in the listing date is going to be the current date and time but you can easily change it with

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,030
the date picker.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,190
OK and then the time picker.

78
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,910
So this is just amazing functionality to have right out of the box like for us to create this interface

79
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,560
would have would have taken just oh I don't know how long but a long time.

80
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:22,240
So that's why Django is just an incredible framework especially for freelancers.

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:32,070
So I think what I want to do now before we start adding data is also add the realtors in the in the

82
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,070
admin area.

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,830
So to do that we're going to do the same thing we're going to go back to the US Code and let's just

84
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:47,410
copy these two lines here and go to realtors admin dot tie in pieces and Except we're going to change

85
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:55,090
this to a realtor and we want to register the model of Realtor.

86
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,580
So I save that we go back and we reload.

87
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,940
Now we can see realtors if I say add realtor we get the name the photo description phone.

88
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,960
Email is MVP.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
So that's for the seller of the month.

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,870
And it's not checked by default because we set false to be the default value.

91
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,970
And then the higher date which of course we can change if we want.

92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,030
All right so now we have realtors and listings as part of our admin area and another thing you can do

93
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,620
is over here you can view the site you can change your password so whatever user you logged in as you

94
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,770
can change password you can log out and we're going to customize this pretty nicely like we're going

95
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,770
to obviously Gengel administration we don't want that you're not going to want to give this to a client

96
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,750
with that.

97
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:47,500
We're going to actually put their logo here and we're going to change the colors to their branding colors

98
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,710
so it matches the front end and then we have a lot of customization to do for how the data is displayed.

99
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,500
Right now you can't really see it because we haven't added anything.

100
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,100
But once we add a listing you'll see it's going to look a little funny.

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,090
We're going to want to really specify what we want to show like in the table and so on.

102
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,410
All right.

103
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,560
So we're going to do all that.

104
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,030
But before we get into customisation I just want to add some data.

105
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,180
OK so in the next video we're going to go ahead and add at our realtor's upload the images all that

106
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,670
stuff and also add our listings.

107
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,610
All right and then we can work on customizing this admin area.
