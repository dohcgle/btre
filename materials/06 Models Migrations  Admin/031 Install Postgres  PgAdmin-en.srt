1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,670
Our guys so we have our listings view all set.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,390
But of course it's just static HDMI markup.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,060
We want this.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,990
We want these listings to come from the database and we want to be able to add them through the admin

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,060
area.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,560
But before we do that we need to set up a database.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,640
OK so we're going to use post-grads which is a very powerful relational database.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,950
It pairs very well with Django.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,180
If he used my ascii well or even like Microsoft SU all server very similar there they're all SU or relational

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,810
databases that use structured query language although with Gengel we don't have to write raw Eskew all

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,180
queries we have a higher level Aurum to deal with fetching data inserting data and so on.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,340
All right so it makes it much much easier.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,750
Now as far as installing post-grads locally it's a little different on Windows and Mac.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,310
What I would suggest if you're on Windows is to go to post grad school dot or go to download click on

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,460
Windows and download the graphical installer.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,970
OK and just go through that.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm using version 10 so that's what I would suggest if you want to use 9.6 That's fine if there's a

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,380
later version later stable version.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,250
You can probably get away with that as well.

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,720
So it's up to you.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,120
And if you've installed post-grads before you know how to do it.

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,470
If you have a different way of doing it by all means you know as long as you have postscripts on your

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,320
system then that's that's all we need.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,720
OK so on a Mac I would suggest using post-grads app at post-grads app dot com.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,910
This just makes things a little bit easier or gives you a little interface to work with.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,860
So we're going to go ahead and click download here and this is post-grads app dot com.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,540
And before I actually install this I just want to also mention another tool called PGE admin and this

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,660
gives you a graphical user interface to deal with your databases and can be very helpful especially

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,920
if you're not that comfortable with the terminal.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,540
If you want to look at your tables and your data stuff like that.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,730
So we'll also get that installed and this is available on Windows and Mac.

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,500
OK.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,980
So we're going to go ahead and let's actually download this to.

34
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,260
I'm going to go to download OK if you're on Windows you want to click here but on a Mac so I'm going

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,430
to click here.

36
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,100
Latest Version it was.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,050
Yeah that's the latest version.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm going to get the DMD on Windows it'll be in Ex-Sea.

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:31,500
All right so now it's let's install postgrads apps so I'm going to open up that file that I downloaded.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,930
All right so I'm just going to break drag this post-grads over to my applications folder.

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,390
And I have had this installed on this machine before so there might be some very subtle differences

42
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,240
than what you see but I'll explain that.

43
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:50,620
All right.

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,700
So once that's in the Applications folder if nothing happens just open it up from within the Applications

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:04,440
folder or so ago and DoubleClick postgrads can close this up and it should just ask us if we want to

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:04,980
open it.

47
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,710
So I'll go ahead and click open and there we go.

48
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,630
Now you probably if you haven't installed this before you probably won't see these three databases here

49
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,590
and you'll probably see something that says initialize.

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,150
So just go ahead and click that initialize and then you should see these.

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,840
OK and this is your server settings which includes your port number the default post-grads port data

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,280
directory config file if you want to you know edit any of those or whatever you can go into there.

53
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,850
So what I'm going to do now is double click on postgrads and it's going to open up a terminal with you

54
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,980
know inside of our post-crash show.

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,310
So we need to create a new database.

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,540
Now as far as users I'm going to use this the post-grads user.

57
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,710
OK you always have this route post-grads user.

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,120
And I wouldn't use this in deployment but on development I think it's fine to use so we're just going

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,620
to use that but we want to give the post-grad user a password.

60
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:10,230
So what we want to do is backslash password and then the user name which is post-grads OK and then we

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,410
just want to enter a password.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,410
Now we want to create a new database so we're going to say create a database and I'm going to call this

63
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,980
a b t r d d and I'm just going to do owner.

64
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm going to specify that the owner should be the post-grads user.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,930
OK and then we want to put a semi-colon at the end and run that and we get create the database.

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:46,870
OK now if we do a backslash L which is a list database's you'll see VTR DBI and the owner of post-grads.

67
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,870
OK so we should be good with that.

68
00:04:49,950 --> 00:05:02,430
Now we can exit this by doing a backslash Q And now for PGE admen let's let's take care of that so we're

69
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,990
going to go ahead and close this up.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,070
So just remember we have a database of Beati Ari D.B and the owners postgrads.

71
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,650
So now we're going to just keep this running.

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,680
We can close this up but it's still running you should actually see a little elephant icon in your top

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,580
right if you're on a Mac.

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,350
So for PGE admen see where is it.

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,460
Let's open that up

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,830
and we'll just agree OK so what we want to do is we want to move this.

77
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,330
I mean we can run it from here but I'm going to move it to my Applications folder.

78
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,220
So I'm going to just open a new Finder and go to my applications which is right here.

79
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,930
OK I'll bring that over

80
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,080
because if you run up from here and then you add in you ejected.

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,400
It's not going to run anymore it's going to be it's not going to be available.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,320
All right so now that is in our applications it's close this up and let's run P.G. for RPG Augen for

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,190
you and we'll get this message you just want to say open.

84
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,250
It's going to start the program this should also create a little icon up in the top right.

85
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,120
And now this is going to run in the browser.

86
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,020
OK it's a browser based tool.

87
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,150
And over here on the left under servers you see that there's nothing here.

88
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:42,100
Now I believe on Windows if you if you install postgrads and then you install PGE admin and you open

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,580
it up you'll see your it'll just kind of create a server with your current databases and if you want

90
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,170
you can create the database that we just created the Tiare D-B from here.

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,040
OK because you can create databases from here if nothing is here then just simply say create server

92
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,970
and give it a name I'm going to call mine DBI server and go to a connection and you want to specify

93
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,910
that this is local your local hose connection and then your username postgrads and whatever password

94
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,950
you used for post-grads which we just did in the terminal.

95
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:27,720
So let's say save now for go to D-B server on our databases you'll see our BT are the D-B database along

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,590
with the other two.

97
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,530
The default database is but this is the one that we're going to be using.

98
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,080
Ok so I think everything should be configured correctly.

99
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,990
Let me just check out the properties here so why is that.

100
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,660
Given this just a spellcheck thing.

101
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm the owner of postgrads so definition security

102
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,310
now.

103
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,840
I think we might have to add privileges here let's say

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,660
when we use say post-grads privileges.

105
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,250
OK so we probably want to do this or we might get some restrictions so we're going to choose the post-grads

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:21,490
user and say all and that should be good Granter postgrads.

107
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,610
I'm not sure if we need to do this since we're using the post-grads user but I'm just going to do it

108
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,650
anyways and just say save.

109
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,950
All right so we should be all set.

110
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,860
Now guys in the next video we're going to start to configure Django to use postgrads because right now

111
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,120
it's configured to use Eskew light.

112
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,630
So we're going to do that and then we'll move on to migrations and we'll start really getting into like

113
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,460
our models and stuff like that.

114
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,960
All right so see you in the next video.
