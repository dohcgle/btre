1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,020
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,650
Now that we have post-grads installed we're going to start to implement it with our Django app.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,360
OK.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,230
Now to use post-grads we need to define the parameters in the settings file but we also need to install

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,920
a couple of packages using Pipp so that it can basically like basically like drivers to connect to post-grads

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,650
so make sure you're in your V or whatever you call your virtual environment and let's do a pip install

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,450
and we're going to do it's.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:36,870
P.S. Why CEO PGE to say we want to install that.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,730
And then we also want to do that same thing but Dasch binary.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,350
OK so we want to install those two back.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,210
Is it clear the up.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,290
And then we're going to go to settings up high and go down to look.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,830
So let me make this smaller.

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,240
We're going to go down to where it says database our databases.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:05,200
And this is where we want to set up all of our parameters including the driver including the username

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,770
password.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,920
Things like that.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,930
So first of all we want to change this Eskdale life 3 to postgrads.

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,530
Q Well

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:24,670
and then for the name we're going to get rid of this and we just want to put what we called our database

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,220
which was B T R E D V K.

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:44,310
And we also want to add the user which in my case uses postgrads and then we want the password OK.

23
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,410
So my password.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:56,760
I just use 1 through 6 and then we also want to add the host which is going to be our local host OK.

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,080
So let's save that.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,830
And by the way my my my jingoes server is still running if I go to my other tab here you know see my

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,740
jingoes service still running.

28
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,220
Now as far as this message right here and you guys saw this a long time ago when we first started the

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:24,340
server basically we have some on applied migrations and a migration is a file that that tells the database

30
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,230
what to do.

31
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:33,100
Basically as far as setting up tables and data columns and data types of each each for each column and

32
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,270
stuff like that.

33
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,200
And Django has default migrations for things like the admin area for authentication.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,520
There's going to be users that have to do with the admin area that that stuff is all set up.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,400
Those migration files are set up.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,180
They just haven't been run and put into the database.

37
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,490
So what we want to do now is basically run those migrations.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,840
And once we do that we won't see this error anymore so let's go ahead and just I'm going to just stop

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:12,210
the server here I'll stop this and clear it up now to basically to migrate.

40
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,570
We're going to create our own migrations for like the listings and the realtors and stuff like that.

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,270
But to run the current migrations that are already ready like those 15 that were in that message we

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,220
just want to say Python manage dot PI and then migrate.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,370
OK now something isn't right with our database we're going to see an error here.

44
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,130
So let's just try it out.

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,810
OK it looks like everything went OK.

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,230
OK.

47
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:47,870
So now we can I mean you could jump into your terminal if you want or you can jump into PGE admin and

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,080
reload.

49
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,180
And let's take a look under servers D-B server.

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:03,330
When you look under databases BTR VDB schemas public tables and look at that.

51
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,880
Look at all these tables that have been created.

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,100
So we have our off user table.

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,490
We have user groups even our migrations get tracked in the database they have their own table groups

54
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,570
permissions.

55
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,450
All of this Django stuff is now in the tables.

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,880
Ok that's exactly what we want.

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:28,460
So so we know that post-grads is now is now interacting with our Gengel application which is perfect.

58
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,090
All right so let's hop back into this code and let's start our server back up.

59
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,360
So I'm going to do Python managed up-I run server and now notice we don't see those red arrows anymore.

60
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,290
OK because those migrations have now been applied.

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,300
So we're now in a great place because we can now start to create our models.

62
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,510
Our database is connected and we can start to create our own migration so that we can create tables

63
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,970
for listings and realtors and stuff like that.

64
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,300
All right.

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,690
So we'll get started on that in the next video.
