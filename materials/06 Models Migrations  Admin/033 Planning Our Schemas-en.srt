1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,650
All right guys so before we actually jump in to code it's always a good idea to map out your your database

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,470
schema OK before you do that because you want to know exactly what you're doing exactly what fields

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,200
you're putting into your models.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,540
So usually the way that you figure this out is by looking at the requirements what what needs to be

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,510
displayed on this in this application and this Web site.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,430
So I have the initial requirements here and then they have a text file called schemas dot taxed and

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,080
we're just going to map out our scheme and now if you want to use more advanced software where you can

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,340
have a little diagram with boxes that are connected and stuff like that you can do that.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,400
I just want to keep it simple.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,590
So in this file it's a model slash D.B fields.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,320
OK.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,260
So basically we're going to have three separate tables for what we need and one table is going to be

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,330
listings or I'll just call it listing because the model name will be singular so I'll say listing let's

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,210
say realtor and let's say contact.

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:21,120
OK so basically listings are the property listings of the realtors and then contact is any inquiry that's

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,650
made to the application should be saved in the database in a table and a contact table.

17
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,140
So let's start off by figuring out what fields the listing listings will have.

18
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,450
OK now if we go down to the bottom here we have a listing page field so this is basically what they

19
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,440
want displayed on the single listing page.

20
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:55,560
So let's start off with just putting in an ID because of course every every table needs to have an ID

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,280
column.

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,720
And with postgrads the way that things are set up.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,640
It's that ID will get put in automatically and it will also be auto increment.

24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,600
So we don't have to worry about putting in the ID when we insert data.

25
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,330
So an ID is going to be of the data type of event.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,800
All right.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,170
Now we also want to connect connect realtors to listings.

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,890
OK because each realtor is assigned a group of listings.

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,960
So when we go to like let's say 45 main street there should be a realtor that's in charge of 45 Main

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Street.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,110
So that means that we have to have a realtor field OK and it's going to be an integer but it's going

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,890
to be a foreign key fields.

33
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:50,730
And when I say foreign key from the realtor table the realtor model.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,590
All right.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,680
That way we can associate an entire realtor and all of their fields with a listing.

36
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,890
So that way like if we wanted to display in their image or their name or their contact info in a listing

37
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,630
page we could do that because we have an entire realtor connected to the listing.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,710
So next thing we'll need is a title as you can see in the document so let's say title titles are going

39
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,160
to be a string.

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
Put a call in here.

41
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,560
OK.

42
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,580
So we have title we have address.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,900
In most cases the title will be the address but they'll have the option for it not to be.

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,060
Also you can see where they want the whole address so will also need a city to be a string will need

45
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,940
a state string and do zip code

46
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,650
OK.

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,060
So that's the address.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,220
We also want a description which is actually not here is it.

49
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,810
It's actually not in the.

50
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,740
The initial requirements I may add it so you may see it but it's not here.

51
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:06,330
But we know that we do need a description OK and that's going to be a string actually that's going to

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:14,730
be a text field which is a little different because it's going to be longer so we also want price.

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,620
OK.

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,280
Price is going to be in and.

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,260
It's not going to be a float because there's not going to be any like there's not going be any decimal

56
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,720
points.

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,510
I can do sense on prices of homes.

58
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,200
So an inch is just fine.

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,830
Let's see.

60
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:37,800
We also want bedrooms in bathrooms so bedroom bedrooms is going to be in it's just a number of bedrooms

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,230
same thing with bathrooms

62
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,700
OK so let's see what else we want at garage.

63
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,570
Garage is going to be an inside number a garage.

64
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,160
It will do zero as the default.

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,320
Let's see we also want a list.

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,380
So instead of a list underscore a date that's going to be of the type of day.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,020
So real her name and image this is going to come from this foreign key right here.

68
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:14,610
So we'll be able to get anything about the realtor by use by forming that relationship.

69
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,050
We also need the square feet in lot size.

70
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,180
What about that so it's here we'll say Eskew.

71
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,940
That's going to be in and out and then a lot size.

72
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:39,000
So lot size is actually going to be a float because I want to be able to do say like 1.2 acres or 2.3

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,260
acres or something like that.

74
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,080
So we'll save float for a lot size.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,760
It would seem so for images.

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,070
We basically want to have one main image and then it says five other images but I want to do six.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,340
So we're going to do.

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,780
We're going to do a photo underscore main which will be strong and just to be clear we're not actually

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,390
storing images in a database.

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,120
We're storing the location of the image.

81
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,610
That way we can fetch that location and we can simply put it into an image source so that it displays

82
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,700
on the page.

83
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,460
OK so we'll have the main image and then we'll have photo underscore one.

84
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:32,340
And then we'll have one through six so I'm just going to copy that two three four five six and we'll

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,410
just go ahead and change these up.

86
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,740
So 1:36 and that should do it for our listings case.

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,170
These are all the fields that we're going to need in the listing model and these will all get created

88
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,210
as rows in the listings table in the database.

89
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,630
So now let's let's do the realtor.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,820
So for realtor we're going to have an ID.

91
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:10,010
OK all all tables will have an ID that will be in and we're also going to want the realtor's name so

92
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,340
it's do string and for name it's just it's going to be first and last name I don't want to have them

93
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,570
separate fields.

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,270
Also photo there should be one photo of the Realtor also a description.

95
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,160
So just like a short description let's say text for that.

96
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:37,890
And let's see we're going to want a and email a phone

97
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,880
now remember that number they want the option to do a seller of the month.

98
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,790
So we need a field for that which will be a boolean.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,620
That reminds me of something I've forgotten the listings as well which I'll get to but I'm going to

100
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,420
call this is MVP something short list is MVP and then that will be a boolean.

101
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:00,730
All right.

102
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,560
Now what I forgot up here in the listings is remember they also want the option to publish an unpublished

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,490
listings.

104
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,650
So we need to add that as a field as well.

105
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,820
So let's go Ray here and say is underscore published.

106
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:19,900
OK.

107
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,720
And that's going to be a boolean.

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,970
And then in brackets here let's put the default so we want the default to be true which should be published

109
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,640
by default.

110
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,440
All right.

111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,130
Also garage.

112
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,620
I want to have a default of 0 and then for the MVP of course you want a default of 0

113
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,020
and the last thing we want for realtor is the higher date.

114
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,080
OK so that's going to be a day.

115
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,480
So it's just the date they were hired.

116
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:51,850
All right.

117
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,620
So I'm going to just save this so far.

118
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,160
And now we just have the contacts came in contacts are just like the inquiries that are sent in.

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,490
So each one will have an ID when we just move this up.

120
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,640
So we will have an ID.

121
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,940
Also we want to know which user are sent in that inquiry if the users are registered and logged in.

122
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,780
So let's say a user underscore ID and that will be an event.

123
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,620
And we also want to know the listing.

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:34,030
And and I'm also going to do the listing I.D. So the listing is actually going to be connected to the

125
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,380
title or the name of the listing and then the ID will obviously be the ID.

126
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:47,480
OK we also want a name should be string will be the name of the person that's sending in the inquiry

127
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,470
we want their email phone

128
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,370
and a message

129
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:06,380
and then we also want a contact date which should be a date and that's it.

130
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,660
That's our entire schema.

131
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,780
So when we create our models and Django we want to model it after this file and after all these fields.

132
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,380
OK.

133
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,100
So that's all I want to do in this video guys in the next one will start to actually create the models.

134
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,280
All right so I'll see that.
