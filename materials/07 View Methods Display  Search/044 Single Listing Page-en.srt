1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,620
All right guys soon this video we're going to start to think about the single listings page.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,100
OK so when we go to our listings and we click on more info.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,410
The road is all set.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,380
The template is displaying But we want this to display the correct mark up as well as we want to reach

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,510
into the database and display the correct listing data.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,420
OK so let's jump in the VS code and basically two files we're going to need to work on.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,120
One is listings views dot pi.

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,940
OK because now we're dealing with this method this is the single listing.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,240
And we also want to open up the template in templates listings and then listing it aged himself.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,720
So these two files.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,090
So first thing I'm going to do is get the markup.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,480
Now remember I have in Sublime Text I have our bootstrap theme.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,920
Just all the static data not data but static markup each time.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,790
And we're going to open up a listing Daut aged mail.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,820
We don't want to take everything because remember although like the head tag all that stuff that's in

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,900
the base lay out we don't need that we don't need the top bar or the nav bar.

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,030
All we need is from here.

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,190
So this section right here and we want to go all the way down.

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,260
To right above the footer I believe is what we want.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,130
So right above the footer.

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:26,130
OK so we're going to grab that and we're going to first of all before I paste that in I'm going to extend

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:35,990
the base layout so I'm going to just to extend base Daut each team now they want to make sure we do

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,320
that.

24
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,680
And then remember everything that we want in this template has to be wrapped in a block.

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:58,260
So let's put right here we want to do block content and we want to end that block.

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,040
Another thing I'm going to do is load humanised because we're going to want to use that as well.

27
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,810
So we might as well throw that in now while we're here.

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,450
All right.

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,340
And then in between the block content I'm going to paste everything I just copied so if I save this

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,030
and we go back and reload.

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,720
There we go.

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,360
OK now it's just it's just static markup right now.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,200
The form will open if we click the make inquiry because we do have the the each team for the the motile

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,850
But let's start to make this dynamic.

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,150
OK so in order to do that we're going to need to to reach into the model and grab this particular listings

36
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,060
data.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,480
So to do that we need to go to use dot PI and down in the listing method.

38
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,070
OK we want to use de-listing model which we already brought in.

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,880
You can see we already brought that into this file.

40
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,900
Now I'm going to set a variable called listing singular and instead of just doing listing objects I

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:09,750
actually want to do something called Get underscore object underscore or underscore 404.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,740
Now what this is going to do is it's going to make it so that if I go to like let's say listings slash

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,680
10.

44
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,930
OK if I go to that right now nothing happens but I want that to show a 404 page.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,190
So that's what this is going to do.

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,360
It's going to check to see if it exists.

47
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,990
So we need to pass in two things one is going to be the model.

48
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,740
And second is going to be the primary key we want to set P K equals and then the listing underscore

49
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,370
ID.

50
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:46,070
Now this comes in right here and this listing ID is passed in through the u r l right here.

51
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,490
OK and if you look at the browser it's this here.

52
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,510
OK.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:03,370
So now that we've done that let's go ahead and create our contex variable contacts not Konst So contacts

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:14,310
and we're going to set listing and let's set that to listing and then we'll pass in the context

55
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,480
that.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,080
OK let's go ahead and save this.

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,290
Now this object of 404 you actually have to bring that in.

58
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,750
It's from jingoes shortcut.

59
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:36,140
So along with the render we hadn't bring that in so we'll say get underscore object or UPS or underscore

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,540
404.

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,730
I will save now that red line should go away and it should work.

62
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,720
So let's go back and if I go to listings slash 10 which doesn't exist we get page not found.

63
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,550
All right if we go to six slash six that does exist.

64
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,860
So that's going to work.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,650
OK.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,600
So anything I go to five that should work.

67
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,820
We have six total.

68
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,150
So we should have I.D. 1 through 6.

69
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,960
All right so now we've done that we should be able to access the listing data within the template because

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,640
we passed it in here with with the contacts.

71
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,180
So it's good to listing each team now.

72
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,940
Let's go up to the very top and I want the title displayed right here.

73
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,600
So we should be able to just simply say listing dot title.

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,380
Okay let's see if that works we'll go back and reload.

75
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,790
There it is 12 United road.

76
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:40,870
If we go back to the listings page and click on let's say Giffard that works as well.

77
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,360
So let's head back to listing dot HVM balance.

78
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,210
Finish this up so I'm going to copy what we just did here with the listing title and we're going to

79
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,920
do the same for the city the state and the zip code.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,260
So this will be city

81
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,800
state

82
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,810
and zip code.

83
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,900
All right now down here in the breadcrumb we want to fix these links here so to go to the home we want

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:23,380
to do our tags and we want to say you are ill and we wanted to go to index and then this should go to

85
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,450
the listings page so this will be

86
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,740
you are Al

87
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,120
listings.

88
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,720
OK.

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:45,260
Now this here is the title again because this is in the breadcrumb so I'm also going to put listing

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,670
title here.

91
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:52,050
So whatever the title is will actually be in the breadcrumb and then for the listing itself this back

92
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,640
should be the same as this.

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,280
This right here your L listings.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,030
OK we never want to do an H html page that that's just what we did for the theme.

95
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:13,350
So it's do you l listings and then down here we want the main image.

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,180
So I'm going to pay Sison and it's called Photo underscore main is the name of the field and we want

97
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,710
to you are l.

98
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,270
So let's just see if that works we'll go back and reload.

99
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,480
And there we go and you can see the title is now on the bright chrome we have our links to go back in

100
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,330
the breadcrumb we have the main image.

101
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,290
Now we want to do all of the smaller images underneath.

102
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,800
Right now they're not showing because this this doesn't exist this location.

103
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:54,440
So what we need to do is just put in dynamic values just like we did for the photo above.

104
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:04,230
So we want to do photo underscore one Daut you RL And we want to do the same thing for the image tag

105
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,100
so this should be for the link and the image tag that's how the Lightbox chooses the images.

106
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,140
OK so we want to just paste that in and let's do that for all of these.

107
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,010
So we're going to just grab that and the next one.

108
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,700
OK paste that in except to will the photo to answer the same thing here.

109
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:30,110
So highlight this to a control D to get the next one pasted in changes to three we'll do it here as

110
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,160
well.

111
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:41,330
Change this to control d paste save for 4.

112
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,030
All right.

113
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,070
And I'm going to show we get if we have to do another step after this because we might not have these

114
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:53,550
photos so we do have to do an if statement around them or will get an error or so let's go ahead and

115
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,400
put these in here this is for photo 5.

116
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,960
Can this last one here is going to be photo 6.

117
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,920
All right so let's take a look at that.

118
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,140
Let's save this.

119
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,940
Let's go back and let's reload.

120
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,550
Now this this particular listing happens to have six images so there's no issues and you'll see if we

121
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,540
open it up and we can pretty much just navigate through all the images which is part of the requirements

122
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,620
for the project.

123
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,380
But let's go back to a listing that doesn't have all of the images.

124
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,880
And notice we get an error saying photo four attribute has no file associated with it.

125
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,250
So what's going on is it's it's trying to load photo for when there isn't a file for it because we didn't

126
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,040
we didn't add photo four for this listing.

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,100
So the solution for this is just to wrap these in if statements checking to see if the photos actually

128
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,010
there because remember they're optional.

129
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,710
So where we want to put this is right above the call M.D to.

130
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,900
OK so we're going to put an if statement here.

131
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,520
You know we're going to do if listing dot photo underscore one.

132
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,500
OK that's it.

133
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,970
And we're going to end it after the div..

134
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:22,700
So we're going to do and fight that and right under it we're going to do another four photo two sort

135
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,380
of say a photo or two.

136
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,530
And what I'm going to do is copy the end if in the beginning if here go under this div pace that we're

137
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,870
going to check for a photo or three.

138
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,050
OK will go to the next one.

139
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,170
We're going to check for photo for next one.

140
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,560
Check for photo five.

141
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,300
Next on Fotos six.

142
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,250
And that's the last one so then we just need an and if we don't need this here.

143
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
So we'll get rid of that.

144
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,480
Now if I save and we go back to that page it just gave us an error and reload it works and it just gives

145
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,060
us the images that it has which is which is only three images and we can still go ahead and navigate

146
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,810
through them.

147
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,320
All right so that's perfect.

148
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,790
So now we want to move on to these fields because right now it's just static HD a mouse.

149
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,910
Let's go down a little further.

150
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,950
Let's go to our price here.

151
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:27,390
OK we're going to leave the dollar sign and we're going to say listing Daut price and remember we brought

152
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,340
in humanised.

153
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,850
That means we can use the pipe character and we can say it comma so we can add the commas.

154
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,690
Let's go right here.

155
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:48,300
Two bedrooms and this is going to be listing two bedrooms and I'm actually going to just copy this and

156
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,440
we'll do bathroom's

157
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,670
OK garage

158
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,530
and see what else we got square feet.

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,520
Is it Eskew T.

160
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,560
So we get squiffy we get lot size.

161
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,650
So right here I'll pass and listing a lot on their scores size.

162
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:27,920
And then for the listing date I actually do want the listing date I'm not going to do like the five

163
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,540
days ago or whatever that's on the main that's on the listings page on this I actually want to put the

164
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,090
listing date so will say listing Daut list underscored date.

165
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,530
And then we want our realtor since we have that relationship between the models we can just simply say

166
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,220
realtor and it will give us his name or her name and then the description.

167
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:56,620
OK want to replace this right here with the listing datt description.

168
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,590
All right.

169
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,950
Let's see then we have the the seller.

170
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,980
This all says seller of the month.

171
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,700
That shouldn't be there I'm just going to get rid of that because this isn't the seller of the month.

172
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,020
This is just who whoever the realtor of the property is and to get his name.

173
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,280
So right here we can just do just like we did above realtor.

174
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,300
All right.

175
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,930
Now see

176
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,940
think great here I think we're good.

177
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,170
You know we should be good for now.

178
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,050
We're not going to handle the increase yet I just want to get the actual day that displayed so always

179
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,190
photo for the photo.

180
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,280
What's cool about about the way that we created the relationship between the listings and the realtors

181
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:54,670
is we can get any realtor field so we can just simply say listing realtor dot photo dot you r l k so

182
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,530
save that let's go back let's reload and there we go.

183
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,330
So the stuff is all coming from the database if we go to a different listing Let's see.

184
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,810
By Mark Hudson we should see his image over here.

185
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,480
One thing I'm seeing though is this each six tags so something is off.

186
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,270
So let's go to the bottom here and just check that out.

187
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,930
Where is it.

188
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,820
That's the motile.

189
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,900
Yeah we just need to add that

190
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,780
ok cool.

191
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,820
All right so I think the next thing that I want to work on is the search.

192
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,870
OK so we have the the listing on the home page letus listings.

193
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,390
We have these listings.

194
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,410
We can go to a single line and we can go to them from the home page as well obviously.

195
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,030
So I want to work on the home search right here.

196
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,450
And once we submit this it'll go to a search it will show a search template which will look like the

197
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:03,360
listings page like this except it'll have another search form up here if you want to make another search.

198
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,770
OK so we're going to get into that in the next section.
