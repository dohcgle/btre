1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,380
Art guys who in the last video we went ahead and created the single page listings.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,920
OK so these are now working for the inquiry form but we're going to get to that later.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,770
What I want to do now is work on the search.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,490
OK and before we do the search submission I want to shore up the template and let me show you what I

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:20,730
mean.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,270
So if I go to pages index dot index each time how all of the select lists here I want to shorten this

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:35,130
up so all these states and and the bedrooms and prices so we can shorten this up by putting these values

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,680
into a python dictionary and then just importing them and looping through them and then just outputting

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,010
these from the loop.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,930
OK so I'll show you what I mean.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm going to create a file inside the listings app since these have to do with listings.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,370
And we're going to call this choices Daut pi.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,310
OK.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,620
Now I'm actually going to paste all this stuff in.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,510
You can copy it or you can go to the final project files and you can copy it from there and paste it

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,970
in.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,340
I'm going to go through it real quick.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,700
Basically we have three dictionaries we have bedroom choices.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,220
OK.

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,670
And then each one has a key a key value pair.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,810
OK so the key is going to be used for the value attribute.

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,640
OK so for like the state this will be the key whenever we assign this will be the value.

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,750
In the dictionary.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,430
So bedroom's we're just going to have 1 1 2 2 and so on pricing.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,150
The actual value that's going to be searched in the database will be this.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,260
This is what will be displayed to the user in the form.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,040
Same thing here.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,230
This will be searched and the databases will be displayed to the user base.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,380
We just have all the states and all the prices and the bedrooms.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:57,460
We're going to save this file and we want to go to our pages app and then fused up high because the

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,250
index page the home page is what we're working with.

32
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,350
So we want to bring that file and so I'm going to say from and since it's in the listings folder or

33
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,580
the listings app we have to save listings dot choices and then I'm going to say imports and we want

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:22,060
price choices bedroom choices and state choices and then we just simply want to pass them into the index

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,160
age him all through the contacts.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,200
So I'm going to say state choices will be state choices.

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:40,030
Copy this down two more times and this one here will do the bedroom choices

38
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,770
bedroom choices and then this one here will be price choices

39
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,280
in price choices.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,770
OK.

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,740
So now these are going to get passed in soon to save this.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,710
And remember these are just separate dictionaries with values.

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,530
So now in the index each team now we're going to loop through each of these that have these option fields

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,450
OK and we want to have a value and just display text so let's start with the states.

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm actually going to we're going to keep this because it's like the heading.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,450
It just says you know what this is.

47
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,510
And then I'm going to get rid of everything else.

48
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,340
OK all these options are going to replace these and that's you'll see it's going to make this file a

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,120
lot shorter.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,220
So just all the options keep the select.

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,190
So get rid of those.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:39,300
And then we're going to loop through by saying for now we want the key and the value OK meaning key

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,980
and value not just the value so you could do whatever you want here you could do Cavey.

54
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm just going to do key value like that and we're going to say in state underscore choices because

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,580
I was remember that was passed in.

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,050
And then we want to end the for loop.

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:11,310
So it's OK and for OK now for each one what we want to do is output we want to output an option with

58
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,180
a value.

59
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,040
So let's say option and the value is going to be the key and that sounds a little weird.

60
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,370
The value would be the key but the actual value of the dictionary is going to go here that's going to

61
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,740
be the text that displays like that.

62
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,990
OK so let's save that.

63
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,470
Now this should work if we go back to our index and reload we should see the same thing all the.

64
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,940
Well that's not right.

65
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,790
That is not right.

66
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,500
See what happened here.

67
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,940
So for key value.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh you know what it is.

69
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,360
We need to do dot items here.

70
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,220
I think that that should fix it.

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,900
Because up to that point it's just getting He is just getting the first letter.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,550
There we go.

73
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:03,940
All right.

74
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,980
So now we have all the states and it's coming from that choices file.

75
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:15,310
So now let's do the same thing for the other ones I want to copy this whole for loop now for the bedrooms.

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,930
For some reason we don't have the value here but that's fine because we're going to have it now.

77
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,230
So going to replace all of these pay sat in and we're just going to say instead of state choices is

78
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,140
going to be from the bedroom choices dictionary and leave the same thing here.

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,410
Key value that's fine and let's do the same for price.

80
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,160
OK leave that.

81
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,830
Leave the first option and then just replace all of these.

82
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,510
And we're just going to change this to price choices dot items.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,940
So let's try that will reload.

84
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,710
So for a state that works bedroom's good price good.

85
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,460
So now what I want to do is handle this submit if I submit it now it goes.

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,810
It tries to get a search done each time which isn't even a thing.

87
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,290
So we have to change that.

88
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,130
First of all so in our form Let's go.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,370
Let's see where is the form.

90
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,460
Where is the form.

91
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,970
I'm missing you right here.

92
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,110
So as you can see we have action to search out each time.

93
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,670
We don't want that of course so I'm going to go ahead and put our tags in.

94
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:31,250
We actually want this to go to you Arel and then search.

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,860
OK.

96
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,090
So save that.

97
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,980
And if we go to our you Earles dot PI inside listings we have search right here and you can see name

98
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,050
equal search.

99
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,550
So what should happen is it should call this this view method the search method which if we look at

100
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,720
the used up high in listings we have right here and it's just going to load searched each time.

101
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,690
So what would she have and now once they reload and we submit it to just go to that search template

102
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,450
that's what we should see which right now just hasn't H-1 in it.

103
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,780
OK.

104
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,560
And if we were to put values in here like in the key words and city and cement you can see that they're

105
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,430
actually up here.

106
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,550
So these are get requests values.

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,570
So let's let's actually add the markup to the search page.

108
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:25,040
So I'm going to go to back to Sublime Text which has our bootstrap theme and there's a search for each

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
team page.

110
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,270
Obviously we don't want the top stuff the top bar nav bar.

111
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,960
We want to start let's see what is this.

112
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,350
Yeah we want to start right after the NAVs So this section here

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,820
is second so we want yeah because this is going to have this search.

114
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,590
Another search box in it.

115
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,850
So let's grab from here all the way down.

116
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,700
We're going to do the same thing with the choices that we did in the other form as well.

117
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:07,280
So scrabble all this OK down to right above the footer and then we're going to go back to let's go to

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,410
templates listings search dot reached him which is right here and we're going to paste all of this in.

119
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:24,660
All right so I'm going to just save this and then go back to our Web site and let's submit the form

120
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,930
so it brings us to that page right now.

121
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,820
I forgot to extend the base layout.

122
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,830
That's why we're not seeing any styling or anything so up at the very top.

123
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,210
Let's go ahead and

124
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,400
want to extends

125
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:52,510
beseeched him our dog paged him now and we're going to need human eyes as well so let's load that

126
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:07,570
OK and then we have to wrap all this stuff in a block so block content and then down at the very bottom

127
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:18,970
we want to end that block.

128
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,590
All right.

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,060
So I save that we go back to the search page.

130
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,330
Now we have the layout and as you can see there's a little form at the top.

131
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,880
And then this is going to be just like the listings page.

132
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,600
Ok except it's going to actually have our search results if we search for only Massachusetts we should

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,700
only get those listings.

134
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,370
All right.

135
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,750
We probably won't get to that in this video but I at least want to get our choices into the HDMI like

136
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,720
we did in the other forum.

137
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:52,420
So let's go to this time listings used up high.

138
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:59,110
In fact what I'm going to do is go to the other views dot Pi from pages and just copy this because we're

139
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,200
going to bring in all the choices into listings.

140
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:10,330
So up at the top here I'll paste that in and just like we did here we're going to pass in all these

141
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,650
choices.

142
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:21,650
So let's go back to listings used up high and we're going to go down to search and actually know what

143
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,360
we need a context here.

144
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,100
K they will pay so Zen

145
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,840
and pass in the context

146
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,960
and then we should have access to those dictionaries just like we did in the in the home page.

147
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,780
So from the home page I'm just going to copy one of those loops we did this right here.

148
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,200
And go to our search.

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:59,090
Aged hemol and do the same thing where we have our options so and go away up to the top.

150
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,640
See way up here.

151
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,650
So for pricing Let's leave the first option.

152
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,870
Replace all these OK so this is going to be price choices.

153
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,710
Guy.

154
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,930
This is going to be the bedrooms.

155
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,410
So one through 10 or replace that with price choices.

156
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:30,430
And then we also have states so we're going to replace those that are in that state.

157
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,490
All right.

158
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,170
And then one thing I forgot to do is on the listings used up pie we don't need to actually say listings

159
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,960
because we're already in that out.

160
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,660
So we can just do door choices and save and now go back and make sure that that form still shows which

161
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,140
it does.

162
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,200
Well two prices for bedrooms yet.

163
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,370
I must have good prices for a bedroom.

164
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,490
So let's go back to the search.

165
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:06,430
Each team will then go down to the bedrooms and right here I just want to change this bedroom choices.

166
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,860
Here we go.

167
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,410
All right.

168
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,200
So we have our search form.

169
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,580
One more thing I want to do before I go before we move on to the next video is the breadcrumb which

170
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,880
is right below it.

171
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,540
And we want to change.

172
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,870
Oh no we already did that.

173
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,590
Sorry.

174
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,450
OK so that's good.

175
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:26,960
All right.

176
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,330
So I think what we'll do in the next video is start to work on our queries so when we actually put some

177
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,390
search fields in.

178
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,290
It's going to get caught in this search method right here.

179
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,670
And we're going to have to make some queries we're going to base our extraction from the database or

180
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,350
the objects that we take from the listings we're going have to base that on whatever the user puts in

181
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,430
the search fields.

182
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,230
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
