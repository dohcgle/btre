1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:07,590
All right guys so in this video what I want to do is make it so that when we search something such as

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,560
bedrooms or price or whatever that it stays in the form once it shows us the results.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,450
So to do that we're going to edit our search each time I'll file but we also want to go to our listings

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,310
used up PI.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,830
And I just want to pass in something with our contacts so I'm going to add to this.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,550
I'm going to add he's using me I'm going to add values as our key and then I'm just going to pass in

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,420
the whole get requests we're going to say request Daut get get like that.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,870
All right.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,600
And then whatever we search for if we put like pool in keywords then request dot get keywords should

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,180
be available to us as values dot keywords.

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,820
OK.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,300
So let's go back to search a CML and let's go to our keywords right here and we're going to add in a

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:12,820
value attribute OK so it's a value and we'll say values which we just passed in through our context.

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,720
Key words.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,840
Let's save that.

16
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,790
Let's try that out.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:26,740
So if I go and we go to our home page and he's going to reload and search for pool and submit OK so

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,390
we get our results and now pool is still there.

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,210
If I search again for boards still there good.

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,850
It's exactly what we want.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,250
So when do the same thing for City.

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:45,600
So we're going to add and value equals we want to have our quotes here.

23
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,220
So this is going to be values dot city.

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,780
Now the text fields the input fields like that those are easy because we can simply put a value for

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,570
the select list.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,270
It's a little different.

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,620
What we want to do is have a conditional in here.

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:11,680
So we want to put an if statement and what we want to search is we want to say if key.

29
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:22,390
OK so if the key is equal to values dot state you know what we want to put this in here because the

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,980
way that we makes an option selected is we add selected like that but we need to loop through and decide

31
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,780
which one is going to be selected.

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,350
So this if statement actually needs to go within there so we're going to just cut it from here and go

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,350
right here after the double quote.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,960
Put a space put my statement in and I think we can get away with doing this on separate lines so let's

35
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,660
do that just to make it look a little neater.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,300
So remember right after the single quote here and we're going to put our F and then our END-IF

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,950
K so if the key K right if the key is equal to the key is actually the value of the option.

38
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,630
But if that's equal to values not stay then we just want to show selected.

39
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,010
Right.

40
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,570
So we're just going to put in here the words selected.

41
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,070
We want to add that as an attribute.

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,380
So that should work let's try it out.

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,250
So I'm going to go to the home page and I'm going to search for California and submit.

44
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,730
And now California is still there.

45
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,980
OK if I submit again even if I put let's say pool let's say city.

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,110
I don't know what's a city in California San Diego.

47
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,960
I spell that right.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,860
I don't know.

49
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,570
Submit.

50
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,790
And they all stay good.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,470
So let's go back and let's do the same thing for the other subjects.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:06,860
So I'll actually copy let's see option key and then we did our if statement here.

53
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,820
So we're going to grab this just this just to the END-IF like that and then we'll go down to the next

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,870
option.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,560
We want to go right after the quote After the key going to go in a separate line here and paste that

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,600
in TAB this over just to look a little better.

57
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:27,960
OK.

58
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,520
But we don't want to do values dot state because this is the bedroom field so we're going to save values

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,740
dot bedrooms.

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,220
OK whatever the name is because that's what's getting sent to the server.

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,440
So will do that.

62
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,990
And then down here we want the price so again right after the quote record here.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:55,740
Place that in and we want to save values dot and this is price.

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,170
All right.

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,710
So that should do it.

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,420
So let's go back and I'm going to go to the home page and let's just do everything.

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,680
So poor city will say

68
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:18,540
Boston Massachusetts bedrooms for price 600 and submit and they're all still there.

69
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,260
OK and then we could change our search up.

70
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,970
So let's change it to something that will actually show up.

71
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:37,140
So say 600 and let's do nor would get rid of poor I think Norwood had four bedrooms.

72
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,040
There we go.

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,700
All right so our search searchers now working guys.

74
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,630
So I think they think the next thing that I want to work on is the authentication.

75
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,080
We want to be able to register from the front end log in them or work on our inquiries.

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,550
We also want to have messaging.

77
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,410
So for instance when we log in we want something that says you have been logged in stuff like that.

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,890
So Gengel actually has a messaging app that comes with it by default so we'll be using that.

79
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,150
All right so I will see you in the next video.
