1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,150
All right guys so now we're going to get functionality to this to search forms both of them.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,780
Basically what we need to do is when we make a search like let's say we put like pool or something or

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,200
we choose bedrooms.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,740
Any field we fill in when we submit we're going to want to first check to see if that field exists.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,170
And then we're going to want to pull it out of the request or pull it out of the request I guess we

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,320
could say and put it into a variable and then we're going to want to base our query set based on that

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,780
variable we're going to want to filter by that.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,830
So if they say state Alabama then we're going to want to put a filter for state of Alabama.

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,640
OK.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,710
So we want to do this one by one and we're going to do this in the listings used up high in the search.

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,340
OK.

12
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,720
So right up at the top here I'm going to start what we're going to call a query set list and we can

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,060
build on to this.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,950
So we're going to see a query set on this score list and I'm initially going to set this to the listing

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,360
model.

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,190
OK.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:25,280
We're going to say Dot objects dot order underscore by and let's order by this date.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,970
OK so this this query alone is basically just just like the listings page writes the same thing it's

19
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,290
just going to get all of the listings.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,890
So what we need to do is just add filters for the search.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,960
But I think I think what I'm going to do first is just pass it in like this so we can get the template

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
all set up.

23
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,950
I think that's that's a better idea so that we can actually see our results so let's go ahead and pass

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:03,200
in the contacts and we'll say listing our listings and hopes we want to set that to our queries set

25
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,390
list.

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,450
OK.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,880
So now before we do all the search stuff here let's actually just render the what we're getting from

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,600
this in the template and we can do that by just copying just literally copying what we have in listings.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,650
Each team will show up at the top here are not the top but right here where we check for listings we

30
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,190
do all that stuff.

31
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,310
We actually want the same thing in the search results.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,410
OK so let's copy from here if listings down to the END-IF.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,350
All right and then we're going to go to our search Daut Tamal.

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,200
And we want to put this right under the ROE So we want to get rid of listing 1 2 and 1 through 6 actually

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,560
right.

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,010
Six of them.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,170
So when it go that's 5.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,470
All right.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,940
So that's down to 5 and I just want to make sure I'm right about where we're listing 6 ends so I'm going

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,210
to just highlight that div and it ends right here so I want to get rid of that as well.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,390
Listing 6 Okay.

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,470
And then in this row is where we want to pace what I just copied

43
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,600
okay and everything should be the same really because it's coming in his listings.

44
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,450
Okay.

45
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,370
It will be filtered but for now it should just show all of the listings.

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,710
Let's say that let's go back to searched on each team L and see if that works so if we reload we get

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,520
all of our listings.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,780
All right and we might as well add the pagination as well.

49
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,620
Actually no what I don't think I'm actually not going to keep the pagination here on the search Yes

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:04:00,120
let's get rid of this this mark up here where it is and that row is here that may or may not be in your

51
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,180
version of the theme because we're not going to use it.

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,860
All right so now that we're actually showing listings let's go let's add some filters so let's go back

53
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,650
to the used up PI and see how we want to do this.

54
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's just start with searching for keywords.

55
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,110
Okay because we have a keywords field.

56
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,730
So when we go right down here and I'm going to just comment all the fields so I'll say keywords and

57
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,120
first thing we want to do is check if it exists so we can say if

58
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:45,800
keywords in request Daut get.

59
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,340
Okay.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,510
When you make a request with this form it's a get request and you can actually test to see if it exists.

61
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,950
OK.

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,770
Now if it does let's to let's indent over.

63
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:04,600
If it does then we want to do keywords create a variable called keywords and we can get the actual form

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,520
value by saying request dog get.

65
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,520
And then inside brackets keywords OK.

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,830
So after we do that I'm actually going to do another if I am going to say if keywords.

67
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,750
And the reason I'm doing that is because I want to make sure it's not an empty string.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,240
So if keywords then we want to take our query list or query set list and we want to set a filter on

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,380
it.

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:45,020
So we're going to do a query query set list Daut filter and remember the filter method.

71
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,860
And we actually want to search the description for any words that are typed into this keyword box.

72
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,410
So the way we do that is say description.

73
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,240
And if we're doing a search like that that's not an exact match like with our states we're going to

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,890
we're going to say we want to look where Alabama equals Alabama in that in that actual database field

75
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:14,990
in this case we want to search a whole paragraph for let's say the word pool or something like that.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,890
So when we do that we use this double underscore after the field we're searching and we do I contains

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,080
OK because we're seeing if that paragraph contains this word and it's going to be keywords like that.

78
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,330
OK.

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
All rights.

80
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,500
So I think that should do it.

81
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,550
I mean we could probably just test it now so save.

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,940
And no we don't have great descriptions.

83
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,950
I think we just have dummy data.

84
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,740
Let's say let's reload ups we have an

85
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,830
sure what happened here.

86
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,580
All right looks like our service stops did something wrong.

87
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,600
Let's take a look.

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm going to go into my server terminal OK.

89
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:13,020
So if keywords and requests get oh I forgot the code on it's an if statement so we need our coal and

90
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,560
parts and our servers running again.

91
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,470
Good so I'm going to go back and let's reload.

92
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,780
All right.

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,990
So if we look at like one of the descriptions it's I mean it's all this dummy text search for this word

94
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,680
here.

95
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,970
Pro-and.

96
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:40,120
So if we go back here and we say Parowan and search I think I think they all have the same description

97
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,690
so that that may not help.

98
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,310
Let's go let's go in the admin area and let's actually just add something to a description we can search

99
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,580
for.

100
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:56,810
So I'll go to listings go to thirty Esack circle and then the end here we'll just say has pool.

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,850
OK I'll save this.

102
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,700
So ideally you want to save it and then let's go back to the home page here and let's search for pool

103
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,280
and submit and there it is.

104
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,650
So we just have our Essex circle property because that's the only one where the description has poor.

105
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,960
All right so that's working.

106
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,910
And we should be able to do it from here as well.

107
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,330
This should go to the same place which it doesn't.

108
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,240
It still goes to search HD Maol So that's something we need to change.

109
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:36,980
So in our search each team will go up to the form and change this to

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,440
you are search

111
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,560
pools.

112
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,280
OK.

113
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,350
Now if we submit this with no search fields here we should get everything OK all the listings.

114
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,750
All right.

115
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:11,420
Now for the other fields here like let's let's do City next city is also a textfield but with city we

116
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:18,710
want to match the exact We want to match the exact thing if we put Chicago we want to match that exact

117
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,630
text string in the database.

118
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:33,120
So inside of used up PI here let's go under where we did the keywords and let's do City.

119
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,870
I'm actually going to copy this

120
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:46,310
and we're going to say if City in request get there we're going to create a variable called City

121
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,160
change that we're going to see if City

122
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,410
then let's do query list equals queery list not filter and we want the name of the field which is going

123
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:09,040
to be city but instead of contains We want to match it exact rights we're going to do I exact equals

124
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
and then the city very variable.

125
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,760
So let's go back and let's reload and let's see we have let's do Bedford

126
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,070
so Bedford's submit there go see we had Lexington actually.

127
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,480
We have them in the drop downs here.

128
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,300
Lexington good Norwood.

129
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,060
All right so cities working let's search with a lower case so what's to Lexington with a lower case

130
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,500
L OK and that works as well.

131
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,840
And the reason that that works is because I used I exact which is case insensitive.

132
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,440
OK if you want it to be case sensitive then you would just use exact.

133
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,110
All right so let's move on here.

134
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,290
Next thing we want is the state.

135
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,250
So let's copy this.

136
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,950
And if you ever want to add a field you basically just have to do this just add to the query set.

137
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:22,200
So I'm going to do a control d again again and again and again and just change them all to stay.

138
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,490
OK you can try that out.

139
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,020
Load OK.

140
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,210
So if we reload it still in the Get request.

141
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:39,540
So what I'll do is just go to the home page and let's just choose choose something we don't have like

142
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,510
Alabama.

143
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,400
So we get no listings.

144
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:48,140
OK now let's choose mass and we only have our mass listings.

145
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,060
None of the New Hamp none of the New Hampshire ones.

146
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,240
Good.

147
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:58,470
So that's working let's try the city and state together so if we do like Norwood Alabama and submit

148
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,370
that doesn't work if we do.

149
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,920
Nor would Massachusetts and submit that works.

150
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,360
OK.

151
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,670
And I'm going to show you guys in a bit probably in the next video how to keep your like if we put Norwood

152
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,780
in here and we search.

153
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,790
I want Norwood to stay in there.

154
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,390
OK.

155
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,080
So show me how to do that.

156
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,900
But let's finish actually being being able to search these fields.

157
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,160
So next we want to do bedroom's.

158
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,780
So when we grab that

159
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,560
you know we're going to change all these two bedrooms.

160
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,880
And again we're going to do exact.

161
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,560
Actually no I'm sorry we're not going to do exact since.

162
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,160
I mean there's there's different ways you could do this if you wanted to search for exact You could

163
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:04,120
but the way that I want this to work is if someone chooses four bedrooms I want them to get everything

164
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,880
up to four bedrooms.

165
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,130
OK.

166
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,150
So they shouldn't see anything 5:06 or anything like that.

167
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,290
I want them to just see what they what they're basically searching what they could afford which is a

168
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,370
four bedroom.

169
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,400
So anything up to that and you could make this more advanced if you wanted to you can change different

170
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,790
parameters and stuff but I'm just going to do up to four bedrooms so to do that we don't want I exact

171
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,170
you could do exactly like I said if you wanted to match the bedrooms Exactly.

172
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,420
But what I'm going to use here is LTE.

173
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,420
OK so this is it will basically be less than OK.

174
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,830
Less than or equal to LTE.

175
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,950
So let's try that.

176
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:54,240
We'll save let's go back and I forget exactly what bedrooms we have here sort of 5 3 3 3 4 3.

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,310
So we don't even have any two bedrooms so let's choose a let's choose three bedrooms and then this five

178
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,140
shouldn't show up.

179
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,790
This shouldn't show up.

180
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,460
OK.

181
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,270
So let's go back here and let's choose bedrooms

182
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,690
so choose three and submit and there we go.

183
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,060
So we only get the three.

184
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:25,370
If I choose four we should get four four and all of the theories but we don't see the five because that's

185
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,720
that's beyond our search.

186
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,940
OK we're not looking for anything more than four bedrooms.

187
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,610
All right so we're going to do the same kind of thing with the.

188
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,880
Actually we don't have a bathroom search that's right.

189
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,300
All right so we're going to do the same thing with the price though.

190
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:46,100
I'm going to say up to a certain amount because that's usually how people search and what actually I

191
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,070
just bought a house is what actually prompted me to build this application because I was using apps

192
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,750
like this to look for a house.

193
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,510
So it's changed this to price.

194
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:07,700
And then of these two price we're going to leave LTE and then that should be it that's dead should do

195
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:23,260
it for the search for go back home and let's say we want to price to do up to 400000 submit.

196
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,080
OK so that didn't work because this is showing that it should be showing 400000

197
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,630
OK that did work.

198
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,320
Three hundred thousand.

199
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,560
All right.

200
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,520
Let's go back to the home I think we might have something might have something to do with how this form

201
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,900
is set up let's choose 300 and submit.

202
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,360
OK.

203
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,510
So that's not working.

204
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,700
So what I'm going to do is head back to the index page.

205
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,620
So templates pages indexed age HTML.

206
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,350
Let's take a look at the price

207
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,430
OK.

208
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,620
And the issue here is that the select for price doesn't have a name.

209
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,140
So it's not knowing to look for the price.

210
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,000
So if hopefully I remember you guys probably won't have to add this.

211
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm going to add it so you guys don't have to.

212
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,240
But just in case I forget for some reason just go ahead and put a name equals price.

213
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:27,990
OK.

214
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,480
But I think I'm going to fix that after this video.

215
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,990
So now if we go home and we go to 400000 and submit.

216
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,530
There we go.

217
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,320
So now it works because that name attribute that's what the server sees.

218
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:50,450
OK when you're when you're in your search here you're on your search in your views file and you're looking

219
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,490
at requests I get dog bedrooms.

220
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,360
What this is looking at is the field the form field that has the name of bedrooms.

221
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,460
OK this is looking for the field with the name of price.

222
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,850
If you don't have that name attribute it's not going to know what you're talking about.

223
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,310
OK.

224
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,310
So that's when you're dealing with server side that one in the front end the name attribute is the most

225
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,370
important when it comes to submitting a form.

226
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:16,760
All right.

227
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,590
And of course the action of the form tag because that that tells it where to submit to.

228
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,890
So in the next video I want to show you guys how we can actually make it so that when we search for

229
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:35,120
like a city it will stay at that point if we pick a state and we submit it doesn't go back to State

230
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
like this.

231
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,980
OK so we'll do that in the next video.
