1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,340
All right guys so in the last video we went ahead and took our basically took our model our listings

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,640
model and took out all the objects from the database and pass them into the template.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,060
We also looped through those listings.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,650
But right now we're just outputting static.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,600
Each team all for each one we're basically outputting the same exact thing for every listing that's

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,930
in the database.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,270
OK.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,290
You'll see we have six here which is correct.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,020
There's six in the database.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,030
As you can see we added six but there's no dynamic data here so that's what we need to do now is fix

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,330
that.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,320
So let's go to listings dot each team L and go inside our FOR loop here and just replace all the static

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,110
data with dynamic variables and we can do that by let's take this tile for example.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
We can do that by using double curly braces.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,530
OK so that's the template syntax for this.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,830
Now when we loop through we said for listing in listings remember listings is what we passed into the

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,690
template.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,580
And we're saying for every instance or every iteration I should say we're going to call it listing.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
OK so we can say listing and then we can access whatever property we want.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
So here we want the title.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,260
So listing title.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,430
So if I save this and I go back and reload and we look at the titles you'll see that now they're all

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,180
different.

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,850
OK so now they're actually reflecting the correct titles that you can see here that are in the database.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,280
So we want to do that with every field that's here.

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,720
So another one we want to do is the image now Gengel makes it really easy by using that member that

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,290
image field that we used.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,080
It makes it very easy because we can simply just do our syntax here and we can say listing and then

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,180
the name of the the image field which in this case is main What was it main photo.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,480
Was it main photo or photo main.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,960
It was photo main.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,520
So let's do listing Daut photo underscore main.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,170
And then we just want to do dot you are l.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,070
So if I save that we go back and reload.

35
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,730
Now we get all of our images so these are the correct images that were uploaded.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
So now let's do the price.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Let's leave the dollar sign and let's do listing price.

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:22,930
OK.

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:30,530
So we'll go back and check now it worked it's getting the correct number but we want calm is here OK

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,090
this doesn't this doesn't look very professional.

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,610
So you have a couple of options for this one simple option is to use something called humanised it's

42
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:46,280
actually an app that is not included by default in the settings but we can include it and then we can

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,200
use it and it has a method called into Khama that we can just simply tack on to listing dot price.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,910
So what we're going to do is go into our settings.

45
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,280
So it's going to be Tiare settings up-I and there's a lot of files here kicking the can get kind of

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,360
confusing.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,390
That's one thing I don't really like about the Django structure it always seems to just be just a ton

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,390
of files and if it's a big application but what we want to do is go up to our installed apps.

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,920
OK so right here installed apps and I'm going to go on to the end here and I'm going to do Django dot

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,400
con Trib dot humanize.

51
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,720
OK.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,320
So that will just allow us to use human eyes.

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,680
Now we're going to save it and go back to our listings and we actually have to load it.

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,290
So up here we're going to put in our syntax like that.

55
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,840
We're going to say load humanize OK.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,110
Now we have access to a whole host of different functions that we can pipe on to two different values.

57
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:06,190
So let's find our price right here and we want to just add a pipe character and then inte comma.

58
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,760
OK let's save that and let's see if it works or reload.

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,360
And there we go.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,560
It automatically puts the comma where it needs to go.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:15,920
All right.

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,810
And if we actually just want to show you something real quick if you search for Django.

63
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,880
Human is.

64
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,610
So this will actually show you his intercom.

65
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,740
This is what we just used and it shows you what it does converts an integer or float adds commas.

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,990
We have the AP number so return the number spelled out.

67
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,240
There's a whole bunch of cool functions that you can use with this humanised.

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,600
So just keep that in mind.

69
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,250
All right so let's go ahead and finish the rest of our fields.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,000
So what else do we have here that needs to be added.

71
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,440
Right here we have the full address.

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,630
Now remember these are separate fields city state zip codes so here we're going to do

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,020
listing dot city.

74
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:16,410
And you can actually copy this and then this is going to be the state and then this is going to be the

75
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,890
zip

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,790
coyotes go around here square feet.

77
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:38,330
So this was I believe Eskew F.T. garage pieces and I will say listing dog garage in what else we get

78
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,810
bedrooms and bathrooms.

79
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,940
So listing

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,010
bedrooms listing Daut bathrooms

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,250
OK.

82
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,350
Let's see we have the realtor.

83
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:07,250
So since this is actually really cool since we have a relationship with between the realtor and the

84
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,750
listing we can just simply say realtor and whatever we put in the model for the realtor and we just

85
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:22,460
check real quick just to show you if we go to realtors and models dot pi.

86
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,400
This right here self-taught name is where we claimed what we want to display here if we just do dot

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,590
realtor which is really cool.

88
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,890
So that should display the name.

89
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:42,200
Now this this two days ago to be able to do this we can actually use part of humanised which is time

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:50,150
since so I'm going to just get rid of that and we're going to say SpaceX is going to be list date.

91
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,330
That's what it is in the database lists underscored date.

92
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,540
And then we can put a pipe in and we can see a time since and that will actually do exactly what we

93
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,600
need.

94
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:01,940
All right.

95
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,030
So let's save that and let's check it out.

96
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,120
OK.

97
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:15,300
So everything should be different for each listing of the address square feet garage.

98
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,920
All that stuff.

99
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,970
And notice the time since it actually gives you the hours.

100
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,040
So one day four hours which is pretty cool.

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,930
Gives you the realtor's name so everything seems to be intact.

102
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,490
All right.

103
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,770
Now let's see this right here.

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,670
Just goes to listing age Tamal that's obviously not what we want.

105
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:46,590
I'm trying to figure out if this would work yet because we we don't have our route for single listings

106
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:46,820
right.

107
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,160
We didn't do that yet.

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,410
Let me just double check.

109
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,590
So you are Elle's.

110
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,210
Oh we did so this route.

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,230
Here are the CRL is listing our listings slash and then whatever the ID.

112
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,000
So that's what we want this button to go to wups.

113
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,650
We want to go back to this and instead of just listing each team which doesn't make sense we want to

114
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:18,900
put in our tags and we want to do you are l and we want to say listing and needs to have an ID parameter

115
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,310
so right here we can say listing Daut ID.

116
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,530
And that should take us to the correct listings so let's save this and see if it works for you reload.

117
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,690
Now if I if I hover over this and you look down in the left in the corner you'll see listings slash

118
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,440
2.

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,630
This one's listing slash 4 slash 5.

120
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,820
So it just gives you the idea if I click on it we get this error.

121
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,510
So what it's saying here is the listing that they got an unexpected keyword argument of listing ID so

122
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,370
I can show you exactly why we're getting this error.

123
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,690
It's because you are Elle's we passed enlisting ID.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,370
This is for the listing method OK which is in views dot pi which is right here.

125
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,260
Now when you pass in a parameter like that you also need to pass it in here.

126
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,810
So we need to actually pass in listing underscore ID.

127
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:21,070
So if I save that and we go back and reload that fixes that error and it loads the listing aged him

128
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,560
all template which we're going to get into in a little bit.

129
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,790
But I think what I want to do next is Hindle the pagination.

130
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,740
OK so I don't want just a never ending list of properties of listings.

131
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,990
I want to be able to page through them.

132
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,350
All right.

133
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,110
So in the next video I'm going to show you how we can implement that and also how we can style it to

134
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,990
look like bootstrap pagination like this so we don't just have like an ugly looking next in previous

135
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,740
or whatever.

136
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,670
We can actually have it look nice it might not look exactly like this but it will look similar.

137
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,690
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
