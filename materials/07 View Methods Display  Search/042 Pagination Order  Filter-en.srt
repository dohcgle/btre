1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,310
Right guys we're going to start to look at adding pagination to our application for our ad for our property

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,110
listings.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,570
Before we we do that I just want to address the little squiggly lines that pilot is now giving us for

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,710
not putting doc strings here basically comments defining what the method does and things can get quite

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,690
annoying sometimes.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,830
So what I wanted to do is I'm just going to basically tell he'll tell the winter to shut up about stuff

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,630
like this.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,470
So I'm going to go to my settings file you can do control or command comma or just go down to the gear

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,790
and then settings.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,710
And I already have the python glinting dot PI args over here.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,050
What I'm going to do is just add to this.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,780
I'm going to put make sure we put a comma there and then I'm going to say dash dash errors.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,690
Dash only.

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,310
OK we'll save that.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,430
And let's go back.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,270
And now those squiggly lines are gone.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:04,020
So let's get into pagination Now this documentation here at Gengel project dot com This explains pagination

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:10,380
you want to go down to using paginate or in view and the first thing we need to do is edit some stuff

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,830
in our method.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,900
Our index method we want to add a paginate are.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
So basically we see paginate or equals paginate and we pass in.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,740
In our case it's going to be our listings.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,520
We say how many per page we want and then we go out here and we get the page from the get requests because

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,340
if you're on let's say Page two you're going to have a u r l parameter that says Page equals 2 and so

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,630
on.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,560
You need to get that and the need to pass that into paginate or doget page.

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,770
So let's let's handle that first.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,610
So we'll go to our index method here.

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,300
All right.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,150
And then we already have listings equals objects at all.

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,380
So right underneath that I'm going to add in a paginate her and we're going to set that equal to paginate

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,690
or just like it said in the documentation.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,900
And we're going to pass in the listings which comes from the database the variable above and then the

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,370
number of listings we want per page.

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,060
Okay and I'm going to do I want 6 per page but just to test things out I'm going to do three.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,980
OK because we only have 6 total and we can't test it if we do 6 per page.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,750
So when want say 3 per page.

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:31,890
Ok then we need to create a variable called page and set that to request dot get dot get and then pass

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,510
in here.

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:39,930
Page because that's the parameter we're looking for then we want a variable called Page underscore listings

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,410
and set this equal to that paginate or value.

42
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,580
And we want to say dog get underscore page and palps that should be an underscore.

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,480
And then we want to pass in page k.

44
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,750
Now instead of passing the listings directly into our context instead of passing this we actually want

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,980
to pass past in our page listings instead.

46
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,290
So let's do that let's just go right here and say paged underscored listings.

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,860
All right so that's the first part.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,050
Okay that takes care of this.

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,710
Now I am getting an error saying that paginate doesn't exist or undefined variable paginate or that's

50
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:28,500
because we actually have to bring this in so up at the top here we're going to say from Django Daut

51
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,230
core Daut paginate or we want to import.

52
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:44,700
Actually going to import a couple of things here we're going to import empty page page not an integer

53
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,460
and paginate.

54
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,450
OK.

55
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,890
And now that paginate should be once I save that red line should be gone.

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,280
All right.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,740
So like I said that's the first part that takes care of fetching from the database what we need.

58
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,190
Now we have to deal with actually displaying it the right way.

59
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,420
So if we go back to the documentation it shows us how to do that.

60
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,030
Except they're using contacts we're using listings but basically we can check to see if there's a previous

61
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,230
page we can put that previous page number or put a link to it.

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:23,670
So you see we would go to the URL and then the parameter of page equals and then the previous page number

63
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,290
down here we can see if it does next.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,880
And then we can make a link going to the next page number.

65
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,060
Now you could simply copy this and paste it in but it's going to look like crap.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
What we want to do is make it look like this.

67
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,660
OK like bootstraps pagination.

68
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,430
And if we look at the markup we have a UL of pagination class of pagination and then every list element

69
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,390
has a class of page item.

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,350
OK so that's really important to remember and then every link has as a class of page link.

71
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,270
And if there's no previous Then we want to have a disabled class ok.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Whichever one is active we have an active class so we're going to kind of combine this and this together

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,350
so that we can have a nice looking pagination.

74
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,350
But just to show you why reload this page we only get three three listings.

75
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,820
Now this here doesn't work.

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,890
This is just this is just markup.

77
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,240
We have we haven't added anything dynamic to this so let's head on over to our template listings daughter

78
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,840
aged him how and what you what you saw there is just this there's nothing there's nothing dynamic it's

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,230
just age you know.

80
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,140
All right so what are you going to do is I'm going to go see.

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,520
Let's first of all do a check to see if there are other pages for instance if there's six listings total.

82
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,070
And we put six per page than we don't want anything to show we don't want any pagination to show so

83
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,710
we want to wrap the whole thing in an IF statement.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:09,230
So at our tags here and we'll say if listings and there's there's something called has underscore other

85
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,780
underscore pages.

86
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:20,580
OK so we will see if there's other pages and we want to end this down below the UL so down here we just

87
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,190
want to do.

88
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,740
And if like that.

89
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,550
And I'm just going to tab the UL over.

90
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,400
OK so that takes care of that part.

91
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,950
Now we want to check to see if there's any previous pages.

92
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:40,240
So let's go see and try to think if I should just delete all this.

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,570
And yeah you know let's let's get rid of all the allies it will just rewrite them.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,150
So I just want to check for previous pages so we're going to do and pagination is always at least in

95
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,110
my experiments.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,650
Experiments experience it's been a pain in the ass in Django actually makes it pretty easy.

97
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,000
It's one of the easier frameworks to deal with pagination and in my opinion.

98
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:16,120
So let's say if listings DOT has underscore previous.

99
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,350
When I keep putting a plus for an underscore.

100
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,070
So if it has previous And then let's do an NF

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,490
OK.

102
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,740
So if it has previous And we want to put an ally in I want to give it a class of page dash item they

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,850
should all have this class all the allies and then inside we want to tag with the class of page Dasch

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,390
link.

105
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,150
And as far as the Tref goes we just want to do.

106
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:56,280
It's going to be the current page and then we want to add a parameter of page equals and put in our

107
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:11,450
double curly brace syntax and say listings Daut previous pervious previous underscore page number on

108
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,530
a page underscore a number.

109
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,280
And inside here we get put like the word previous.

110
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,010
I'm actually going to put some some left facing arrows so we can do that with the entity of Ampere's

111
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,990
stamp L. A.

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,250
Q You go and put a semi-colon.

113
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
OK so give us the arrows.

114
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,480
Now we actually want to have an else so read here.

115
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:49,030
We're going to say else K else then let's say because remember this is if there is a previous item then

116
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,530
we want to link to to go back to the previous.

117
00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:02,620
If there's not then what I want to do is have a disabled link so let's say my class of page item.

118
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,820
And also going to give it a class of disabled OK.

119
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,530
And then within here let's just put in a tag

120
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,220
and we're going to give us a class of page link.

121
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,760
So they should all have a class of page link.

122
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,290
And I'm actually just going to do a class I'm not even going to do in a trough because remember there

123
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,140
is no previous pages.

124
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,820
So I just want to have it like a disabled arrow link so I'll just put in another L A.

125
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,250
Q You know entity and that should do it for that.

126
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,660
So if I save this and we take a look and see if it shows anything it's free load.

127
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,470
OK.

128
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,610
So this is disabled.

129
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,740
Notice there's no pointer I can't.

130
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,610
It doesn't do anything because there's no previous on the first page.

131
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,830
So that's that.

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,890
Now let's move on to all of our links.

133
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,830
OK all of our pages are links to those pages.

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,700
So after this END-IF Well we're going to want to do is loop through our page range.

135
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:20,060
So we do this by saying 4 and this is all in the documentation that I just showed you were just doing

136
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,950
it in a way that styles it in with bootstrap for.

137
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,010
So let's say for I an

138
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:38,130
listings dot paginate or dot page underscore range.

139
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,200
OK so whatever that page Drange is and let's put our end for down here.

140
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,630
All right.

141
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,060
And then we want to do in site here and if

142
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,720
so we want to do and if listings Daut number

143
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,780
save listings that number is equal to that index and then we'll do and END-IF

144
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,940
OK.

145
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,740
So if that's true then let's put in line here.

146
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,760
This is going to be the active link so we're going to do ally we're going to have a class of page Dasch

147
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,970
item and also a class of active

148
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,270
K and then inside there we're going to have a link with the class of page Desch link.

149
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:51,520
And as far as the see we're not going to have in a track it's just going to be an A with a class because

150
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,260
this is the active page.

151
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,840
But in here we want to put whatever the index is so we're just going to go like that.

152
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,880
Right.

153
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,040
And we want an else.

154
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,520
So this list if listings number equals I want an else to this all right.

155
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:16,820
Here let's put in else OK and then we're going to put an ally.

156
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,030
Class of page item no active.

157
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,230
We only want the active if this is true if it's on the current page.

158
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,210
Otherwise we just want page item we want a class of page Dasch link.

159
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,180
And as far as the A-Trak it's going to be it's going to have a page queery and it's going to go to whatever

160
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,030
the value of it is like that.

161
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:49,970
And then inside here we're going to have eyes as well.

162
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,360
All right.

163
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,290
So let's save that and see what we get.

164
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,820
Ok so I'm going to reload and now we get one into one as you can see one is the active I go to two.

165
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,060
Let's see let's make sure these are different.

166
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,030
So you can see 18 Jefferson lane which is the latest.

167
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,690
Or is it actually we didn't even do it by by day did we.

168
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,780
We'll fix that in a minute but yeah now we can go to the second page.

169
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,330
Notice the parameter.

170
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,080
So it's question mark page equals two.

171
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,960
All right.

172
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,000
And we can go previous.

173
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,860
So now that there is a previous We can actually hit that and it brings us back to once this is working

174
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,840
perfectly.

175
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,890
The only thing we need now is the next day if there is a next or not.

176
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,330
Because right now we're on one so there should be a next button here to go to.

177
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,880
So let's let's finish up and do that.

178
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,440
So you have a lot of a lot of ifs here let me just make sure that we're in the right place.

179
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,180
And if

180
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,560
it's the so we want to be outside of the end for you know we want to go right after the end foreign

181
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,020
just like we did with the above.

182
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,370
We did.

183
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:10,270
If we say we said if listings dot has previous.

184
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,660
So we want to do the same with next.

185
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,730
So actually what I'm going to do is copy that and the else one do the same thing with the next.

186
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,050
So right up to the end for I'm going to pay set in and I'm going to change this to if it has next.

187
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,300
OK if it has next then we want to display a list item with page item we want in a tag with the class

188
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,930
of page link and instead of doing listings to our previous page number we want to do next page number

189
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,740
OK and that should do it for that except I want it I want the arrows to face the other way so we just

190
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,420
want to change the L to an R.

191
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:55,910
OK and then at the same time if it's disable our Or if the if has next is false meaning there are no

192
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,510
there is no next page.

193
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,200
Then we want a disabled link but we want it to be a right arrow so we want to just change that to an

194
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,700
R and that should do it save.

195
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,950
Let's go back and reload.

196
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,530
OK so now we're on page 1 so if I click the next arrow brings us to page 2.

197
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,300
And now it's disabled because there is no more there are no more pages to go to.

198
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,820
I can go back and now I can't go back because wrong page 1 and we can of course switch and if with the

199
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,200
more we have the more listings we have.

200
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,820
This should grow with it.

201
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:36,220
And just to prove that let's go ahead and let's change the initial number of listings to 2.

202
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,030
And that should give us an extra page so I'll change that to.

203
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,170
We'll go back and reload and now we have three down here.

204
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,640
Okay.

205
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,460
So we can page through all of them all three.

206
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,750
All right so we know that that's working that's good.

207
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:57,080
Now I'm just going to change this to 6 because that's what I actually want and if I save now the pagination

208
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,480
should go away very low.

209
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,510
There's no pagination because there's all there's six total.

210
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,660
If I add another one if I add a seventh listing then we're going to see the pads down here.

211
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,180
All right.

212
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,430
Now like I said I wanted to make sure that we ordered these by date.

213
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:24,170
So what we can do is go back to our view and go to our index method right here.

214
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:34,610
And instead of just doing it all we can do Daut order underscore by and we can pass in a value.

215
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,390
Okay we want to pass enlistee but I want it to be descending So we're going to do minus to put a hyphen

216
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,370
here list underscore date.

217
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,220
OK so let's save that.

218
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,260
Check it out for reload.

219
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,750
Now the earliest should be first.

220
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,090
Okay.

221
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,960
Now we really can't tell because they're all three days three hours because we added them all the same

222
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,620
time.

223
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,170
But I know that lexing Lexington was the last one that I added.

224
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,990
So that's what I want the most recent should be the first one here.

225
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Okay.

226
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,440
Now one other thing that I want to do is make sure that if they're not published in the back end in

227
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:22,030
the admin area that they don't show if I go ahead and I whereas it a circle that's the yeah that's the

228
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:28,170
Lexington one so I'm going to unpublished this and save and if I go to the front end and I reload.

229
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,580
It's still there.

230
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,620
So we need to add another condition and to do that we can just easily change that on and we do that

231
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,230
with filter if we want to filter something out and then we can put the field that we want.

232
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,010
I'm going to say if is published case this is just whatever the name of the model field is and we want

233
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,280
to say is equal to true.

234
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,920
So now it shouldn't show anything where the public should only show if is published is true anything

235
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,450
that's false should not show.

236
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,710
So let's go back and reload and now you can see the Lexington House does not show.

237
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,760
OK if I go back and publish it and save and reload now it shows.

238
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,510
So that's exactly what I wanted to do.

239
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,130
All right guys.

240
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,580
That's going to be it for this video and I will see you in the next one.
