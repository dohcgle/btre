1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:08,430
All right guys so in the last video we went ahead and added pagination we made it so that only the published

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,900
listings show on the front end web site.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,330
We also did.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,780
We made it so that they're ordered by list state.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,370
Now what I want to do before we move to like the single listing and all that I want to make the home

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,460
page listings dynamic the latest listings here because right now this is just mark up.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:25,820
All right.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,910
I want to take care of that.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,100
I also want to take care of the About page because we have some dynamic data here that needs to be displayed

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,480
like the realtors and the seller of the month.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,410
So we're going to work on that.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:37,800
All right.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,950
So let's head on over to vs code and we're going to close up the pie from the listings app and we're

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,390
going to open up views not pie in pages which I mean just close this too.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,780
So don't confuse people close everything up and go to pages.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,570
We want to go to views dot pi which is very simple right now it's just loading the templates.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,980
I also want to go to the pages index study each team a template where we have the static markup which

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,030
is right here so listing 1 2 and 3.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,080
All right we're basically going to do the same thing we did for the listings page except we only want

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,990
three listings.

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,170
No pagination or anything like that.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:26,190
So in our view even though we're inside the pages app we can we can get any model we want.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,360
So we want to bring in the listing model so we're going to say from listings basically from the listings

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,170
app models.

25
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,020
We want to import the listing model.

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,260
Okay.

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,820
And down here this is going to be pretty simple we're just going to create a listings variable set it

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,690
to the listing model.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:58,460
I do want to order it by dates and when I say order and order underscore by and we want to do by list

30
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,420
date.

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,210
So just underscore day.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,380
And of course we only want the ones that are published even though this is the home page.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,190
We still don't want to show unpublished listings.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:18,150
So we're going to do dot filter and we're going to pass and is underscore published and we only want

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,420
to show ones that are true.

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,890
And then I want to limit this to only three listings so I'm just going to pass on some brackets and

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,910
do Colan 3 that's going to say that we only want 3 listings and then we'll just create a context variable

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:43,980
just like we did in the other views file so intact in text context equals dictionary with listings and

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,550
we'll set that to listings.

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,520
Okay and then we just want to pass that into the index template here like that.

41
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,830
All right.

42
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,350
So that should do it so I'll save now we're passing it into the index each time.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,000
We just need to now receive it and loop through them and display the dynamic data just like we did with

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,730
the listings each team I'll file.

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,230
All right so we're going to go right here.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:18,710
OK right in this row and we just want to do the exact same thing just use a for loop loop through first

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,380
of all we want to check to see if there's any listings.

48
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,620
So for now I'm just going to go right here below the div. of Roe and I'm going to put in my IF statement

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,420
to check if there's any listings.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:43,280
So if listings and let's end that if and if then actually we wanted the else as well

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,920
okay so if there if there are no listings then let's just put a what should we do here.

52
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,260
Let's put a div.

53
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:07,860
So we'll do a div call M.D 12 just a 12 column div in them will put a paragraph in will say no listings

54
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,790
available.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,660
OK.

56
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,570
Now if there are listings that means we want to loop through them so we're going to go right here.

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,060
We're going to put in our tags and we're going to do a four.

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:30,350
So we want to save for listing our singular in listings plural.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
OK then we want to make sure we end that for

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,470
and in here is where we want to put our listing mark up with some dynamic values.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,860
And I'm just going to copy this listing one so this div to this div.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,110
Can I grab that

63
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:01,520
and I'm actually going to cut it out and put it in the four because it's going to display that for each

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,100
one.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,100
And then I'm going to get rid of listing to enlisting three.

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,390
OK.

67
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:15,650
So that's listing to just static stuff listing three ends right here so one can delete that as well.

68
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,750
All right so we shorten up this file quite a bit.

69
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,240
Whoops.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,980
OK.

71
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,170
So let's go ahead and start to change some of this over to dynamic content.

72
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,900
So I'm actually going to Tab this over a bit

73
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,230
so we'll start with let's say the one to do here let's do the image.

74
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,670
So for the image it's going to be pretty much the same exact thing we did on the listings.

75
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,500
So we want to do listing Daut and the field name as photo underscore main.

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,100
And we just want to do dot.

77
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,750
You are L since it was an image field.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,710
All right for the pricing.

79
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,330
I want to do the comma thing just like we did before and remember we used an app called human eyes which

80
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,390
we loaded in the settings file but we have to also load it up at the top to be able to use it.

81
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,710
So we're going to say load

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,790
humanised like that.

83
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,640
OK.

84
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:28,030
And then we're going to go down back down here and we now should be able to put in the listing price

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:44,250
so listing price and we can put a type character and say int comma case that should work.

86
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,080
Now let's do the title

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,250
see a title I actually like to put spaces on the ends here like that.

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,990
You don't have to.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,910
But I think it looks a little cleaner.

90
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,970
All right.

91
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,590
And then what else do we have.

92
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,510
Here we have the the address.

93
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,210
So actually this the listing title and then I'm going to copy this.

94
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,110
And we have three different values here.

95
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,350
So going to paste in all of these and then we're going to change this first one to city.

96
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,410
We're going to change this one to state and this one two zip code.

97
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,310
Sort of reach into the database and they'll get those fields for us.

98
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,850
Then we have the square feet.

99
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:47,740
So I'm going to go ahead and say listing dots as q f t c with the garage.

100
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,400
So just

101
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,880
just copy one of these.

102
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,570
So this will be listing dark garage.

103
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,840
OK then we want bedrooms.

104
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,450
The bathrooms

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,410
Let's see.

106
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,630
So for the realtor we should be able to just do listing our realtor and that will automatically give

107
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,410
us his name

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
and then for the date

109
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,600
we're going to do listing Daut listee.

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,010
So list underscore date and then we want to add a pipe character and we want to use time.

111
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,570
Since.

112
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,500
All right.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,900
Now for the more info obviously we don't want to link to listing each team.

114
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,220
We want to use you are l to make sure we're going to put this in our tags.

115
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:10,690
So we want to use you Arel and we want to go to listing and we also want to pass in the listing dot

116
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,850
I.D..

117
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,180
OK.

118
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,960
For more info.

119
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,990
So let's save that.

120
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,840
Let's go back to our home page type Object listing has no attribute.

121
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,810
Ordered by.

122
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,640
Let's see what's going on there because that's not right.

123
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,560
Listing Daut order by you know what I forgot.

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,510
Objects should be objects ordered by.

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,340
Sorry about that.

126
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,060
And there we go.

127
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,870
We have our latest listings and these are now coming from the database which is exactly what we want.

128
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,800
All right cool.

129
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:57,520
So the next step is for the for the about page K so for the about we want to have the the team members

130
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,320
of the realtors and we want to have the seller of the month as well.

131
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,140
So let's go back to the used up high in our pages we have about right here.

132
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,590
So that's what we want and want to do the same kind of thing except now we're dealing with realtors

133
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,460
so we need the realtor model.

134
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:23,660
So we don't just copy this down and instead of listing we want realtor.

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,730
And this is going to come from realtors dot models.

136
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:42,610
Ok realtors dot models import realtor and let's say we'll do comment here we'll say get all realtors.

137
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,380
So create a variable called realtors and set it to the model.

138
00:10:48,910 --> 00:11:01,490
And we want to do Daut objects and I'm going to do order by hand let's do by hired de.

139
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,150
All right so ordered by hire date.

140
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,270
And let's see we also want to get the seller of the month.

141
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,530
Now remember the sell of the month has the MVP check.

142
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,210
If we go back to the admin area I don't think we actually set it for anybody.

143
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,980
So let's go.

144
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,890
Let's set up for collops we want to go to realtors.

145
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,910
Let's set up for Kyle Brown.

146
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,050
So right here the check I'm going to say is MVP.

147
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,510
Well go ahead and save that.

148
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,080
And now he should be.

149
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,820
We want to make it so that he shows on the About page in that section.

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:47,730
So let's go back and let's say get in the P and all just two MVP underscore realtors.

151
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,960
Now even though we plan on just having one MVP or seller of the month I'm just using these anonymously.

152
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,390
I still want to I still want to grab a group.

153
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,530
Basically there can be more than one.

154
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,250
OK just in case they want to add more than one.

155
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:13,970
So we'll set this to set it to the same thing real Turcotte objects stock order by.

156
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,590
Actually we don't want order by we're just going to do it all.

157
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,410
So dot all and then the filter.

158
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:28,030
So we want to do a filter is going to be by is underscore NBP it's going to look at that field and it's

159
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,620
only going to grab the ones that are true and checking that box off that they just showed you is going

160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,380
to make that true.

161
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,910
So now we just need to make a context.

162
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:50,350
OK so we'll set this to a dictionary and we'll do realtors set that to realtors and then let's do MVP

163
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,160
realtors

164
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,300
so that too MVP realtors and then will just pass the context into the about perfect.

165
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:13,830
So save that and now we want to go to the about each team Al which is right here and let's start off

166
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:22,510
with just doing the whole realtors section so down at the bottom let's see we have like here team.

167
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:30,200
So we have this column this column all these call em d as these are all the team members.

168
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:37,340
So what I'm going to do is go right here above the first call M.D for and I'm going to check for realtors.

169
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:48,030
So if realtors I'd like to just do all my logic up at the top and then we'll just put in what we need

170
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,510
instead of just trying to wrap everything.

171
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,210
OK let's do one else as well because if there are no realtors we'll just say I don't know.

172
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,010
No team member is available.

173
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,200
OK.

174
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:17,110
So so for the else let's do a call dash empty dash 12 paragraph and we'll say no realtor's available.

175
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,670
OK.

176
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,170
And if there are realtors then we want to loop through them

177
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:34,920
so let's say for realtor in realtors and we'll end that for

178
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:45,550
and then we want to grab just one of these div with the call declasse of call em D4.

179
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,710
So just go ahead and cut that out and put that right in that for loop and then we just want to get rid

180
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,570
of the other two.

181
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:53,910
OK.

182
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,870
Because they're just static.

183
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,310
So this one and this one go up to here.

184
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,920
Get rid of that so shorten our page up good.

185
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,660
So now we just want some dynamic stuff in here like the realtor's name.

186
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,250
So we'll go ahead and replace that.

187
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:23,750
So realtor Don name and then the image or the photo.

188
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
So we have real door.

189
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,270
And we just called it photo I believe but it's a you are also want to make sure we put that in there.

190
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,840
OK we also want.

191
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,300
Let's see we have the phone number.

192
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,000
So it's a real to her dot phone

193
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
will do the email

194
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,110
like that.

195
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,570
And I think that's it.

196
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:10,510
So let's go back to the about and reload and go down and there we go.

197
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,980
So these these are actually coming from the database.

198
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,710
OK so what

199
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,670
see.

200
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,860
Let's take care of this now so Realtor of the month or seller of the month MVP whatever you want to

201
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,540
call it let's do that.

202
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,170
We're going to go back to that same template go up to right here.

203
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:41,370
So sell over the month are going to go in this call M.D four and we're going to check for an MVP so

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:51,340
let's say if MVP underscore Realtors like I said we're going to do our logic First up here.

205
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm not going to do it but in house because if there's no MVP we're just we're just not going to display

206
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,500
anything here.

207
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,850
So we'll do the if and then if there is one then we'll go ahead and loop through.

208
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:16,070
So because remember it's going to return in our objects multiple objects but we're just going to make

209
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,680
sure that just one is checked.

210
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,930
But it is possible to check more than one.

211
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,030
So it's safe for the let's just let's just call a realtor.

212
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,990
We can do that in MVP realtors.

213
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,240
That's what matters.

214
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,730
And then we're going to do an end for

215
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,430
k and then I'm going to grab the card.

216
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:50,050
So this right here I cut that out and put that right in there.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,030
And then just replace the name right here

218
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,410
with realtor dot name and remember they also have a description that's it's going to go here

219
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,340
like that.

220
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
OK so let's say actually the photo to make sure we do that

221
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:30,920
so let's see if we want to do realtor dot photo dot you are l and save.

222
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,850
OK let's go back and let's reload.

223
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,560
There we go Kyle Brown.

224
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,650
So let's test it out and let's uncheck Kyle Brown.

225
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,590
So if I do that we should have no seller of the month.

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,500
And let's go ahead and let's make Ginny JOHNSON So our of the month or MVP and reload and there we go.

227
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,920
So this is completely dynamic now.

228
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:56,920
All right good.

229
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:04,840
So next thing I want to do is focus on the single Wisting page so we'll make our queery for a particular

230
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,200
listing because when we click this it takes us to whatever listings slash and then the ID we want to

231
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,640
take that Id make our queery fetch that listing and then load the template.

232
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,230
OK.

233
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:22,300
Now for the template we're going to have to copy a bunch of H.T. mail from the bootstrap theme and then

234
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,840
more we'll just make it dynamic just like we did with these other pages.

235
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,130
All right.

236
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,640
So that's it.

237
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,000
I will see you in the next video.
